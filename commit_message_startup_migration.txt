refactor: Integrate DB migration into startup event

- Reverts the temporary Procfile change.
- Deletes the one-off migration script (`add_resume_columns.py`).
- Adds a database migration function to `main.py` that runs on FastAPI's `startup` event.
- This ensures a more robust and reliable way to apply database schema changes during deployment.
