not opening the door”,
Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of
course, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.
Gregor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he
knew who it was—the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the
only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became
highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees,
every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful
and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he
couldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hours
in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one
of the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even
necessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have
to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that
only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate
it? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any
proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.
There was a loud thump, but it wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was
softened a little by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was also more
elastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too
noticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit
it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against
the carpet.

자들이었는가, 충성스럽고 헌신적인 사람은 한 명도 없었는가, 양심의 가책으로 미쳐서 회사 업무에 아침에 적어도 두 시간은 보내지 않으면 침대에서 나올 수 없는 사람이 없었는가? 견습생 중 한 명에게 문의하게 하는 것으로는 충분하지 않았는가—문의가 필요하다고 가정하더라도—최고 서기 본인이 와야 했고, 그들은 이 모든 무고한 가족에게 이것이 너무 의심스러워서 최고 서기만이 그것을 조사할 지혜를 가질 수 있다고 믿어야 했는가? 그리고 이 생각들 때문에 그가 더 동요했기 때문이지, 어떤 적절한 결정 때문이라기보다는, 그는 온 힘을 다해 침대에서 떨어졌다. 쿵 소리가 났지만, 그것은 정말 큰 소리는 아니었다. 그의 낙하는 카펫 덕분에 조금 완화되었고, 그레고르의 등도 그가 생각했던 것보다 더 탄력적이었기 때문에 소리가 먹먹해져 너무 눈에 띄지 않았다. 그러나 그는 머리를 충분히 조심스럽게 잡지 못했고, 떨어지면서 머리를 부딪혔다. 짜증과 고통 속에서 그는 머리를 돌려 카펫에 문질렀다.

head
disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and
clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.
Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with
his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.

So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the
other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half
of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant
over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had
become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the
other side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite
clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its
façade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual
droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from
breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for
Gregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and
he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of
different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph
of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand
and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his
uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the
front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and
the stairs where they began their way down below.

그 위로 머리가 있었는데, 그는 다른 사람들을 엿보기 위해 한쪽으로 기울였습니다. 한편 날은 훨씬 더 밝아졌습니다. 거리 건너편에 있는 끝없는 회검은색 건물(병원이었다)의 일부가 파사드를 꿰뚫는 창문의 엄숙하고 규칙적인 선과 함께 매우 선명하게 보였습니다. 비는 여전히 내리고 있었고, 이제 크고 개별적인 물방울을 떨어뜨리고 있었는데, 그것들은 땅에 하나씩 떨어졌습니다. 아침 식사 설거지가 식탁 위에 놓여 있었습니다. 그것이 많았던 이유는 그레고르의 아버지에게 아침 식사가 하루 중 가장 중요한 식사였고, 그는 여러 신문을 읽으면서 몇 시간 동안 그것을 늘어뜨리곤 했기 때문입니다. 정확히 맞은편 벽에는 그레고르가 군대에서 중위였을 때의 사진이 걸려 있었습니다. 그의 손에는 칼이 있었고, 그의 제복과 태도에 대한 존경심을 불러일으키는 무심한 미소를 짓고 있었습니다. 복도 문은 열려 있었고, 아파트의 현관문도 열려 있었기 때문에 그는 복도와 그 아래로 내려가는 계단을 볼 수 있었습니다.

of the doors and the other had
clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the
keys were in the other sides.

It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was
put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had
stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as
they went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come
into Gregor’s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time
to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.
For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain
made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he
had been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing
other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It
pressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift
his head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only
regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.

He spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light
sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his
hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes
which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being
he must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest
consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he,
in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.

것이 분명했고, 그것은 그가 자신의 삶을 어떻게 재편해야 할지에 대해 방해받지 않고 생각할 충분한 시간을 주었다. 어떤 이유에서인지, 그가 5년 동안 살고 있었음에도 불구하고, 그가 머물도록 강요된 키가 크고 텅 빈 방은 그를 불안하게 만들었다. 약간의 수치심을 제외하고는 거의 의식하지 못한 채, 그는 소파 밑으로 서둘러 기어 들어갔다. 그것은 그의 등을 약간 눌렀고, 그는 더 이상 머리를 들 수 없었지만, 그럼에도 불구하고 즉시 편안함을 느꼈고, 그의 유일한 후회는 그의 몸이 너무 넓어서 그것을 모두 아래에 넣을 수 없다는 것이었다.

그는 그 밤을 거기서 보냈다. 그는 가끔 가벼운 잠을 잤지만, 배고픔 때문에 자주 불안하게 깨어났고, 어떤 시간은 걱정과 막연한 희망으로 보냈지만, 그것들은 항상 같은 결론으로 이어졌다. 지금 당장은 침착해야 하고, 인내심과 최대한의 배려를 보여야 한다. 그래야 그의 가족이 그의 현재 상태에서 그에게 부과해야 하는 불쾌감을 견딜 수 있을 것이다.

thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where
the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant
sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always
push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied
up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then
on.

If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for
all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to
bear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried
as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it,
and the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so,
but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much
better. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she
entered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly
close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the
view into Gregor’s room, then she would go straight to the window and
pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it
was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little
while. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and
noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while,
knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this
ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him
with the windows closed.

것에 대해 감사할 수 있었다면, 그것을 견디는 것이 더 쉬웠을 것이다. 하지만 그렇지 않았기에 그는 고통을 느꼈다. 그의 여동생은 당연히 그것이 부담스럽지 않은 척하려고 최대한 노력했고, 물론 시간이 지날수록 그녀는 그것을 더 잘하게 되었지만, 시간이 지남에 따라 그레고르도 그것을 훨씬 더 잘 간파할 수 있게 되었다. 그녀가 방에 들어올 때마다 이제는 그에게 매우 불쾌한 일이 되었다. 그녀가 들어서자마자 그녀는 예방 조치로 재빨리 문을 닫아 아무도 그레고르의 방을 들여다보는 광경을 보지 않도록 했고, 그러고 나서 창문으로 곧장 가서 마치 질식할 것처럼 서둘러 거의 열었다. 추웠음에도 불구하고 그녀는 창가에 서서 잠시 동안 깊이 숨을 쉬었다. 그녀는 이 뛰어다니는 행동과 소음으로 하루에 두 번 그레고르를 놀라게 했고, 그는 계속해서 떨면서 소파 밑에 있었고, 그녀가 이 시련을 덜어주고 싶어 한다는 것을 잘 알고 있었지만, 창문을 닫은 채로 같은 방에 있는 것은 그녀에게 불가능했다.

“Oh God, oh God!” Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch
as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. “Gregor!”
shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the
first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She
ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring
her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too—he could save
his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull
himself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he
could advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand
behind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he
startled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and
broke; a splinter cut Gregor’s face, some kind of caustic medicine
splashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took
hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother;
she slammed the door shut with her foot. So now Gregor was shut out
from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could
not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she
had to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait;
and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,
he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in
his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down
into the middle of the dinner table.

But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was
much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out
of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new
address. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons
than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it
would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with
a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from
their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair,
and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike
anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They
carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor
people, Gregor’s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his
mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister
ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but
they just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in
Gregor’s back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had
come back from taking his father to bed Gregor’s mother and sister
would now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek
to cheek; his mother would point to Gregor’s room and say “Close that
door, Grete”, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit
in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit
there staring dry-eyed at the table.

구멍이 몇 개 있는 적절한 상자에 그를 운반하는 것은 아주 쉬웠을 것이다. 가족을 이사 결정에서 망설이게 하는 주된 이유는 그들의 완전한 절망과, 그들이 알고 있거나 친척이 있는 누구에게도 경험되지 않은 불행에 휩싸였다는 생각 때문이었다. 그들은 가난한 사람들이 기대하는 모든 것을 절대적으로 수행했다. 그레고르의 아버지는 은행 직원들에게 아침 식사를 가져다주었고, 어머니는 낯선 사람들의 옷을 세탁하며 자신을 희생했고, 여동생은 손님들의 요청에 따라 계산대 뒤를 뛰어다녔지만, 그들은 더 이상 할 힘이 없었다. 그리고 그레고르의 등 부상은 처음과 마찬가지로 아프기 시작했다. 아버지를 침대로 데려다주고 돌아온 후, 그레고르의 어머니와 여동생은 이제 일하던 것을 내려놓고 서로 가까이 앉아 뺨을 맞대었다. 어머니는 그레고르의 방을 가리키며 "그레테, 문 닫아줘"라고 말했고, 그러면 그는 다시 어둠 속에 있게 되었고, 그들은 옆방에 앉아 눈물을 흘리거나, 단순히 멍하니 식탁을 응시하곤 했다.

Yet
Gregor’s sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one
side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy
expression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head
close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.
Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that
he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been
yearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister
and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her
violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He
never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway;
his shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he
wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the
attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though,
but stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch
with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always
intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told
everyone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come and gone
already?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse to let
anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would
break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her
shoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to
work, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.

하겠다고 결심했다. 이곳에서는 아무도 그녀의 연주를 그만큼 높이 평가하지 않았기 때문이다. 그는 살아있는 동안 결코 그녀를 자신의 방에서 나가게 하고 싶지 않았다. 그의 끔찍한 외모는 적어도 한 번은 그에게 유용해야 했다. 그는 공격자들에게 히스하고 침을 뱉기 위해 자신의 방 모든 문 앞에 있어야 했다. 그러나 그의 여동생은 그와 함께 머물도록 강요되어서는 안 되었지만, 자발적으로 머물러야 했다. 그녀는 소파에 앉아 그에게 귀를 기울이고, 그가 항상 그녀를 음악원에 보내고 싶었다는 것을, 크리스마스 때 그 모든 것을 말했을 것이라는 것을—크리스마스가 정말 왔다가 갔는가?—이 불행이 방해하지 않았다면, 그리고 누구도 그를 단념시키지 못하게 하겠다고 말했을 것이라는 것을 말해줄 것이다. 이 모든 것을 듣고, 여동생은 감격의 눈물을 터뜨렸고, 그레고르는 그녀의 어깨로 올라가 그녀의 목을  بوس했다. 그녀는 일하러 다니기 시작한 이후로 목걸이나 칼라 없이 그것을 깨끗하게 유지했었다.

himself, and the three women followed his
example. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just
look how thin he was. He didn’t eat anything for so long. The food came
out again just the same as when it went in”. Gregor’s body was indeed
completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now
he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make
them look away.

“Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs. Samsa with
a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not
without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened
the window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh
air had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of
March, after all.

The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in
amazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. “Where
is our breakfast?”, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.
She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to
the men that they might like to come into Gregor’s room. They did so,
and stood around Gregor’s corpse with their hands in the pockets of
their well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.

Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his
uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of
them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face
against her father’s arm.

우리와 함께 이 안으로 잠깐 들어오렴.” 삼사 부인이 고통스러운 미소를 지으며 말했다. 그리고 그레테는 시체를 돌아보지 않을 수 없었지만 부모를 따라 침실로 들어갔다. 하녀는 문을 닫고 창문을 활짝 열었다. 아직 이른 아침이었지만 신선한 공기에는 따뜻함이 섞여 있었다. 결국 벌써 3월 말이었다.

세 신사가 자기 방에서 나와 아침 식사를 찾으며 놀라 주위를 둘러보았다. 그들은 잊혀졌던 것이다. “우리 아침 식사는 어디 있소?” 가운데 신사가 짜증스럽게 하녀에게 물었다. 그녀는 단지 손가락을 입술에 대고 남자들에게 조용히 재빨리 신호를 보냈다. 그들이 그레고르의 방으로 들어오도록 말이다. 그들은 그렇게 했고, 손을 낡은 코트 주머니에 꽂은 채 그레고르의 시체 주위에 서 있었다. 이제 방은 꽤 밝았다.

그러자 침실 문이 열렸고 삼사 씨가 제복을 차려입은 채 아내를 한 팔에, 딸을 다른 팔에 끼고 나타났다. 모두 조금씩 울고 있었다. 그레테는 때때로 아버지의 팔에 얼굴을 묻었다.
