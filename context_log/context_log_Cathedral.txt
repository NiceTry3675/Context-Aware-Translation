Here's a style guide for translating Raymond Carver's "Cathedral" for a Korean audience:

---

**Translation Style Guide: "Cathedral" by Raymond Carver**

**Overall Tone & Mood:**
The prevailing tone is **detached, observational, and subtly unsettling**, conveyed through the narrator's slightly bewildered and judgmental perspective. The mood is one of **quiet domesticity disrupted by the unfamiliar and the narrator's own internal discomfort.** Aim to capture this feeling of a seemingly normal situation being viewed through a lens of mild anxiety and lack of understanding.

**Sentence Structure:**
Carver's prose is characterized by its **simplicity and directness**, often employing short, declarative sentences that build a natural, conversational rhythm. For the Korean translation, strive to **mirror this simplicity**. Avoid overly complex or ornate sentence structures. While some adaptation for natural Korean flow is necessary, prioritize conveying the information directly and without unnecessary embellishment. Think of it as "plain speech" rather than highly literary prose.

**Vocabulary:**
Use **modern, everyday Korean vocabulary**. Avoid overly formal or archaic terms. The language should feel accessible and grounded in reality, reflecting the working-class or middle-class setting Carver often portrays. The narrator's language is not particularly sophisticated, so the translation should reflect that. When translating concepts like "in-law's" or "officers' training school," choose terms that are common and easily understood.

**Dialogue Style (if any):**
While this excerpt doesn't contain direct dialogue, the narrator's internal monologue is crucial. The translation should reflect his **plain, sometimes slightly judgmental, and often hesitant way of thinking**.

**Specific Considerations for this Segment:**

*   **"This blind man..."**: The repetitive use of "this blind man" emphasizes the narrator's focus and slight distance. In Korean, you might use a slightly more specific phrasing to capture this, but avoid making it sound too clinical. Consider phrases that highlight his status as an outsider or someone the narrator is observing.
*   **"He was on his way to spend the night."**: This is a simple statement of fact. The Korean translation should be equally direct.
*   **"Arrangements were made."**: This passive construction creates a sense of things happening without explicit agency. A similar neutral or passive phrasing in Korean would be appropriate.
*   **"They made tapes and mailed them back and forth."**: This captures a specific form of communication from the era. Ensure the Korean translation conveys the idea of audio tapes being exchanged.
*   **"I wasn’t enthusiastic about his visit."**: This is a direct statement of the narrator's feeling. A straightforward Korean equivalent is needed.
*   **"His being blind bothered me."**: The phrasing "his being blind" is key. Focus on translating the *fact* of his blindness as the source of the narrator's discomfort.
*   **"My idea of blindness came from the movies."**: This highlights the narrator's limited understanding. The translation should make this clear.
*   **"That summer in Seattle she had needed a job. She didn’t have any money."**: Simple, direct statements of circumstance.
*   **"etc."**: This signifies a shorthand in the narrator's thought process. In Korean, you might convey this with a similar ellipsis or a phrase that implies "and so on."
*   **"military-industrial thing"**: This is a more abstract concept. Translate it in a way that captures the narrator's vague disapproval without over-explaining.
*   **"She got to feeling lonely and cut off from people she kept losing in that moving-around life."**: This is a more descriptive sentence. Aim for a natural flow that conveys the sense of isolation.
*   **"swallowed all the pills and capsules...washed them down with a bottle of gin."**: This is a stark, direct description. The Korean should retain this bluntness.
*   **"But instead of dying, she got sick. She threw up."**: Again, direct and unvarnished. The Korean should be equally matter-of-fact.
*   **"My wife’s officer—why should he have a name"**: This is a rhetorical question that reveals the narrator's dismissal of the husband. The Korean translation should convey this sense of insignificance.

By adhering to these guidelines, the translation will effectively capture the unique voice and atmosphere of Raymond Carver's "Cathedral."

Style and Tone Analysis:
Here's a style guide for the Korean translation of the provided text segment:

**Translation Guidelines:**

*   **Overall Tone & Mood:** The tone is largely **observational and detached**, with an undercurrent of **resentment and subtle anxiety** from the narrator. The narrator is trying to maintain an appearance of composure while internally seething. The mood is one of **awkward social interaction and simmering domestic tension**.

*   **Sentence Structure:** Aim for a blend. While the narrator is observational, their internal thoughts can be slightly more complex. **Embrace moderate sentence length and structure**, leaning towards a **literary, slightly formal prose style (문어체)** where appropriate for descriptions and internal monologue. However, for direct dialogue and more immediate actions, **simpler, more direct Korean structures** can be used to convey the realism of the scene. Avoid overly short, choppy sentences unless specifically reflecting the narrator's internal panic or the blind man's conversational style.

*   **Vocabulary:**
    *   **Narrator's voice:** Generally **neutral to slightly elevated**, reflecting an attempt at sophistication or a certain self-perception, but capable of becoming more blunt or colloquial when expressing negative feelings or making observations about the blind man.
    *   **Blind Man's voice:** Should feel **amiable, perhaps a bit boastful or overly familiar**, and slightly theatrical. His language should be understandable but might have a certain folksy or "regular guy" quality.
    *   **Wife's voice:** Initially polite, but quickly revealing **impatience and irritation**. Her dialogue should reflect this shift.
    *   **Specific terms:** "Amway distributorship" should be translated clearly and directly. "Blind jack-of-all-trades" needs a Korean idiom or phrasing that captures the meaning of someone who dabbles in many things but not necessarily expertly. "Dope" should be translated with an appropriate colloquial term for marijuana.

*   **Dialogue Style:**

    *   **Narrator's Speech:** Generally uses a **polite but somewhat reserved 해요체 (haeyo-che)** when addressing the blind man or wife, but his internal monologue can be more direct. When he offers the dope, his speech becomes more casual and almost conspiratorial.

    *   **Blind Man's Speech:** Uses a **warm, friendly, and slightly folksy 해요체 (haeyo-che)**. He addresses the narrator and his wife with a degree of familiarity, using terms like "my dear" or implied endearments. His questions are direct and engaging. His humor should come across as good-natured, even if it's a bit oblivious.

    *   **Wife's Speech:** Starts with a **polite and perhaps slightly strained 해요체 (haeyo-che)** when addressing the blind man. As her irritation grows, her tone becomes sharper, and her statements can be more direct or even curt, but still within the bounds of polite address unless she's explicitly showing anger. Her final question about the smell should be pointed.

**Specific Actions/Phrases to Consider:**

*   "For the most part, I just listened." - "대부분 나는 그냥 듣기만 했다." (Simple and direct)
*   "Now and then I joined in." - "가끔씩 끼어들기도 했다."
*   "I didn’t want him to think I’d left the room, and I didn’t want her to think I was feeling left out." - This sentence needs careful handling to convey the narrator's insecurity. "내가 방을 나갔다고 생각하게 하고 싶지도 않았고, 내가 소외감을 느끼고 있다고 생각하게 하고 싶지도 않았다." (Slightly longer to capture the dual concern).
*   "They talked of things that had happened to them—to them!—these past ten years." - The emphasis on "them!—them!" suggests surprise or a hint of envy. Consider using particles or rephrasing to emphasize this.
*   "I waited in vain to hear my name on my wife’s sweet lips" - "내 아내의 다정한 입술에서 내 이름이 나오기를 헛되이 기다렸다." (Literary phrasing).
*   "a regular blind jack-of-all-trades" - "이것저것 다 하는 만능 재주꾼" or "못하는 게 없는 사람" with a nuance of "blind" (meaning unaware or perhaps unskilled despite trying many things). Perhaps "온갖 잡기에 능한 사람" or similar.
*   "such as it was" - "보잘것없는 것이었지만" or "그 나름대로" to convey the limited nature of their earnings.
*   "turn his blind face toward me" - "그의 눈먼 얼굴을 내 쪽으로 돌리며" (Direct translation works here).
*   "heading toward a boil" - This idiom needs a good Korean equivalent for growing anger. "점점 화가 나기 시작했다" or "부글부글 끓기 시작했다."
*   "I’ll try some with you." - "같이 좀 해보지." (Casual and accepting).
*   "Damn right." - "당연하지." or "물론이지."
*   "That’s the stuff." - "이거지." or "바로 그거야."
*   "rolled a number" - "말았다" referring to a joint.
*   "in about two shakes" - "금방" or "잠깐이면."
*   "Hold it as long as you can" - "최대한 오래 참아봐요."
*   "My wife gave me a savage look." - "내 아내는 나를 사납게 노려봤다." or "매서운 눈초리를 보냈다."
*   "We thought we’d have us some cannabis." - "우리 대마초 좀 피우려고 했지." (Direct and casual).
*   "This stuff is pretty mellow," "This stuff is mild. It’s dope you can reason with," "It doesn’t mess you up." - These descriptions of the marijuana should be translated to convey its supposed mildness and lack of strong side effects. "이거 꽤 순해," "순한 거야. 이성적으로 대화할 수 있는 마약이지," "정신을 흐트러뜨리지 않아."
*   "Not much it doesn’t, bub." - "그렇지도 않지, 친구." or "그렇게 순하지만은 않을걸." (Slightly challenging or teasing response).
*   "She took it and toked" - "그녀는 그걸 받아 들고 빨았다." or "한 모금 빨았다."

### Immediate Context Used (English):
had another drink. M
wife heaped Robert’s plate with cube steak, scalloped potatoes, green beans. I buttered him up two slices of bread. I said, “Here’s bread and butter for
you.” I swallowed some of my drink. “Now let us pray,” I said, and the blind
man lowered his head. My wife looked at me, her mouth agape. “Pray the
phone won’t ring and the food doesn’t get cold,” I said. We dug in. We ate everything there was to eat on the table. We ate
like there was no tomorrow. We didn’t talk. We ate. We scarfed. We grazed
the table. We were into serious eating. The blind man had right away located
his foods, he knew just where everything was on his plate. I watched with
admiration as he used his knife and fork on the meat. He’d cut two pieces of
the meat, fork the meat into his mouth, and then go all out for the scalloped
potatoes, the beans next, and then he’d tear off a hunk of buttered bread and
eat that. He’d follow this up with a big drink of milk. It didn’t seem to
bother him to use his fingers once in a while, either. We finished everything, including half a strawberry pie. For a few
moments, we sat as if stunned. Swear beaded on our faces. Finally, we got
up from the table and left the dirty plates. We didn’t look back. We took
ourselves into the living room and sank into our places again. Robert and my
wife sat on the sofa. I took the big chair. We had us two or three more drinks
while they talked about the major things that had come to pass for them in
the past ten years.

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
테이블을 훑었다. 우리는 진지하게 먹고 있었다. 그 장님은 즉시 자신의 음식이 어디 있는지 알아냈고, 접시 위 어디에 무엇이 있는지 정확히 알고 있었다. 나는 그가 칼과 포크로 고기를 사용하는 것을 감탄하며 지켜보았다. 그는 고기 두 조각을 자르고, 입에 넣고, 그런 다음 비스킷 감자로 향했고, 그다음에는 콩으로 갔고, 그런 다음 버터 바른 빵 덩어리를 뜯어 그것을 먹었다. 그는 큰 우유 한 모금을 마셨다. 그는 가끔 손가락을 사용하는 것을 망설이지도 않았다. 우리는 딸기 파 반 조각을 포함하여 모든 것을 다 먹었다. 몇 분 동안 우리는 충격을 받은 듯 앉아 있었다. 우리 얼굴에 땀이 송골송골 맺혔다. 마침내 우리는 테이블에서 일어나 더러운 접시들을 놓았다. 우리는 뒤돌아보지 않았다. 우리는 거실로 가서 다시 우리 자리에 앉았다. 로버트와 아내는 소파에 앉았다. 나는 큰 의자에 앉았다. 우리는 지난 십 년 동안 그들에게 일어났던 주요한 일들에 대해 이야기하며 두세 잔 더 마셨다.

Style and Tone Analysis:
Here's a style guide for translating the provided text segment into Korean:

**Overall Tone & Mood:**
The text has a **contemplative, introspective, and slightly surreal** tone. There's a sense of quiet intensity and a focus on internal experience and sensory detail. The mood is one of gradual discovery and a unique form of collaboration, tinged with a touch of the uncanny.

**Sentence Structure:**
*   **Emulate the author's pace:** The English sentences vary in length but often convey a flowing, almost stream-of-consciousness feel, especially in the narrator's internal thoughts. In Korean, aim for a **natural, flowing prose (문체)** that allows for a similar sense of immersion. Avoid overly choppy or fragmented sentences unless specifically reflecting a very brief, direct utterance.
*   **Use connective particles:** Employ Korean particles and conjunctions to link clauses and ideas smoothly, mirroring the way the author connects actions and perceptions.

**Vocabulary:**
*   **Subtle and evocative:** The English uses relatively straightforward vocabulary, but the *combination* of words creates the specific mood. In Korean, choose words that are **precise yet carry a certain weight or understated emotional resonance.**
*   **Focus on sensory experience:** Pay close attention to translating words related to touch ("felt around," "tips of the fingers," "rode my fingers") and perception ("gazed," "tell," "know").
*   **"Bub" translation:** The term "bub" is informal and familiar. A direct translation might not capture the nuance. Consider a Korean equivalent that conveys a similar **casual, slightly patronizing but encouraging familiarity** within the context of the blind man's speech.

**Dialogue Style:**

*   **The Narrator's Speech:**
    *   **Style:** Hesitant, internal, reflective.
    *   **Korean Suggestion:** Use a **plain, declarative style (해요체 or 합쇼체 depending on the overall formality, but 해요체 feels more natural for internal thought and simple responses here)**. Keep sentences relatively concise when directly answering.

*   **The Blind Man's Speech:**
    *   **Style:** Encouraging, instructive, familiar, slightly philosophical, and informal. He uses colloquialisms and tries to draw the narrator out.
    *   **Korean Suggestion:** Employ a **friendly and encouraging 해요체**. Incorporate **colloquialisms and idiomatic expressions** where appropriate to capture his casual yet insightful manner. Phrases like "You got it, bub" or "cooking with gas" need Korean equivalents that convey a similar **enthusiastic, down-to-earth encouragement.** The "old arm" question also suggests a familiar, almost intimate, inquiry.

*   **The Wife's Speech:**
    *   **Style:** Curious, slightly concerned, perhaps a touch bewildered or even detached. Her questions are direct and seeking explanation.
    *   **Korean Suggestion:** Use a **polite but direct 해요체**. Her tone is one of seeking information and understanding from the narrator.

*   **General Dialogue Advice:**
    *   **"Don't fudge":** This is a strong, informal imperative. A Korean translation should convey a similar sense of "don't cheat" or "don't be insincere" in a direct way.
    *   **"It's really something":** This is an expression of admiration or deep impression. Find a Korean phrase that conveys genuine awe or appreciation.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
felt like they didn’t have any strength in
them. They felt like they did after I’d done some running. In my wife’s
room, I looked around. I found some ballpoints in a little basket on her table. And then I tried to think where to look for the kind of paper he was talking
about. Downstairs, in the kitchen, I found a shopping bag with onion skins in
the bottom of the bag. I emptied the bag and shook it. I brought it into the
living room and sat down with it near his legs. I moved some things,
smoothed the wrinkles from the bag, spread it out on the coffee table. The blind man got down from the sofa and sat next to me on the
carpet. He ran his fingers over the paper. He went up and down the sides of
the paper. The edges, even the edges. He fingered the corners. “All right,” he said. “All right, let’s do her.”
He found my hand, the hand with the pen. He closed his hand over my
hand. “Go ahead, bub, draw,” he said. “Draw. You’ll see. I’ll follow along
with you. It’ll be okay. Just begin now like I’m telling you. You’ll see. Draw,” the blind man said. So I began. First I drew a box that looked like a hose. It could have
been the house I lived in. Then I put a roof on it. At either end of the roof, I
drew spires. Crazy. “Swell,” he said. “Terrific. You’re doing fine,” he said. “Never
thought anything like this could happen in your lifetime, did you, bub? Well,
it’s a strange life, we all know that. Go on now. Keep it up.”

I put in windows with arches. I drew flying buttresses.

앉았다. 그는 종이 위를 손가락으로 쓸어내렸다. 그는 종이의 양옆을 오르내렸다. 가장자리까지, 가장자리까지도. 그는 모서리를 더듬었다. “좋아요.” 그가 말했다. “좋아요, 해봅시다.”

그는 펜을 든 내 손을 찾았다. 그는 내 손 위에 자신의 손을 닫았다. “어서요, 친구, 그려봐요.” 그가 말했다. “그려봐요. 알 거예요. 내가 따라갈게요. 괜찮을 거예요. 내가 말하는 대로 시작해요. 알 거예요. 그려봐요.” 장님이 말했다. 그래서 나는 시작했다. 처음에 나는 호스처럼 생긴 상자를 그렸다. 내가 사는 집일 수도 있었다. 그런 다음 나는 그 위에 지붕을 얹었다. 지붕의 양 끝에는 첨탑을 그렸다. 정신 나갔군. “훌륭해요.” 그가 말했다. “멋져요. 잘하고 있어요.” 그가 말했다. “평생 이런 일이 당신에게 일어날 거라고는 생각 못 했죠, 친구? 글쎄요, 세상은 이상하죠, 우리 모두 알잖아요. 계속해요. 계속해요.”

나는 아치형 창문을 넣었다. 나는 날아가는 버트레스를 그렸다.
