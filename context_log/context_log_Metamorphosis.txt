# CONTEXT LOG FOR: Metamorphosis

--- CONTEXT FOR SEGMENT 1 ---

### Static Rules Used:
Global Style: Translate the narration in a formal, literary style (문어체). Avoid overly academic or stiff expressions. The tone should be immersive and engaging for a novel reader.

### AI-Generated Guidelines Used:
Key Term Translations:
Gregor Samsa: 그레고르 잠자

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style

* **Overall Tone:** The narrative tone is predominantly objective and observational, though tinged with Gregor's internal anxieties and growing despair. It's a third-person narrative that intimately reveals Gregor's thoughts and feelings, creating a sense of both distance and empathy.  The style can be described as 문어체 (formal written style) with elements of psychological realism.

* **Key Literary Devices:**  The key literary device is Gregor's internal monologue, which directly conveys his thoughts and anxieties.  The description is highly detailed and realistic, bordering on the grotesque in its depiction of Gregor's transformation.  Irony is subtly present in the juxtaposition of Gregor's inner turmoil with the mundane details of his room and his job.


### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

* **Character: Gregor Samsa (Self)**
    * **Speaking to:** Self
    * **Context/Emotion:**  The emotional context shifts throughout the segment. Initially, there is confusion and bewildered fear ("What's happened to me?"). This transitions to frustration and physical discomfort as he struggles to move.  Finally, it evolves into despair, resentment towards his job, and a resigned acceptance of his situation, punctuated by fleeting moments of hope for the future.
    * **Recommended Speech Style:** Primarily use an informal yet somewhat literary 해요체 (haeyo style) for his internal monologue, reflecting his private thoughts and anxieties.  The tone should shift subtly to reflect his changing emotions—more panicked and fragmented initially, then increasingly despondent and resigned as the passage progresses.  Avoid overly colloquialisms unless they genuinely reflect the character's mental state at a specific moment.  The inner monologue should feel natural and intimate.


* **Character: No other characters speak in this segment.**


**Additional Notes for the Translator:**

* **Maintaining Consistency:**  The translator should strive for consistency in vocabulary and sentence structure throughout the translation to ensure a unified narrative voice.  The use of literary techniques such as imagery and metaphor should be carefully considered to maintain the original's evocative power.

* **Contextual Awareness:** The translator should be mindful of the cultural context of the story (early 20th-century Europe) and adapt the language accordingly, avoiding anachronisms or overly modern expressions. The setting and Gregor's occupation (traveling salesman) should be reflected in the language.

* **Word Choice:**  Careful attention should be paid to the selection of vocabulary to capture the nuances of Gregor's emotional state and the grotesque nature of his transformation.  The translator should avoid overly simplistic or euphemistic language, opting instead for words that accurately convey the unsettling reality of the situation.  Words related to his physical transformation should be chosen carefully to reflect his increasing discomfort and alienation.

* **Sentence Structure:**  The original text utilizes a mix of short, declarative sentences and longer, more descriptive passages. The translator should try to preserve this variation in sentence structure to maintain the dynamic rhythm of the narrative.

* **Vermin Translation:** The translation of "vermin" is crucial.  It should accurately convey the sense of disgust and dehumanization associated with the term, while also avoiding overly simplistic or crude equivalents.  Consider using a more literary and evocative term instead of a purely biological one.

### AI-Generated Guidelines Used:
Key Term Translations:
Gregor: 그레고르
chief clerk: 부장

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style

*   **Overall Tone:** The narrative tone is primarily objective and descriptive, focusing on Gregor's actions and the reactions of those around him.  It maintains a sense of detached observation, even amidst the escalating chaos and Gregor's internal anxieties.  There is a subtle undercurrent of suspense and growing horror.  The style leans towards 문어체 (literary style) due to its detailed descriptions and complex sentence structures.

*   **Key Literary Devices:**  The story employs a significant amount of internal monologue, revealing Gregor's thoughts and anxieties.  The description of the chief clerk's actions uses subtle irony, highlighting his fear and disgust through seemingly insignificant details (protruding lips, trembling shoulders, gradual retreat). The use of imagery, particularly concerning Gregor's transformation and his movements, is crucial to maintaining the unsettling atmosphere.


### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Gregor Samsa**
    *   **Speaking to:** Mother
    *   **Context/Emotion:**  Initially, Gregor speaks gently and calmly to his mother ("Mother, mother"), showing concern and attempting to reassure her. This is contrasted by the involuntary snapping of his jaws, revealing his frustration and the difficulty of his situation.  The context is one of escalating panic and desperation, but his attempts to communicate remain largely compassionate.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**  Use a soft and gentle 해요체 (informal polite speech) when speaking to his mother. The underlying desperation can be conveyed through the choice of vocabulary and sentence structure, rather than a shift to a harsher speech level. The snapping of his jaws could be conveyed through onomatopoeia or descriptive language rather than direct dialogue.

*   **Character: Mother**
    *   **Speaking to:** No one directly addressed in this segment, but her cries are implicitly directed at those around her for help.
    *   **Context/Emotion:**  Initially engrossed in her own thoughts, her reaction to Gregor's appearance is one of pure terror and instinctive flight. Her cries of "Help, for pity's sake, Help!" reflect intense fear and panic.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use a panicked and high-pitched  해요체 (informal polite speech) for her cries.  The choice of words should reflect the immediate, unthinking nature of her fear.  Her exclamation is not directed to a specific person, making 해요체 appropriate.

*   **Character: Chief Clerk**
    *   **Speaking to:** No direct dialogue from the chief clerk in this segment.
    *   **Context/Emotion:**  His actions speak volumes: he is terrified and disgusted by Gregor's transformation. His hasty retreat and frantic gestures convey his extreme fear.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**  No direct dialogue necessitates this section, but his unspoken fear and disgust could be reflected in the narration through descriptive language that emphasizes his physical reactions and lack of words.

*   **Character: Father**
    *   **Speaking to:** No direct dialogue from the father in this segment.
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Reacts to the mother's screaming by rushing to her side, showing concern and protectiveness. This implies his own shock and horror at the situation, though he doesn't speak in this excerpt.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Similar to the Chief Clerk, no dialogue necessitates this section.  His actions and implied feelings can be conveyed through descriptive narrative.


**Note:** Maintaining consistency in tense and aspect is crucial throughout the translation.  The translator should carefully consider the subtle shifts in Gregor's emotional state and reflect these in the choice of vocabulary and sentence structure in Korean. The overall tone should remain consistent with the original's blend of objective description and psychological insight.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the
other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half
of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant
over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had
become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the
other side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite
clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its
façade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual
droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from
breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for
Gregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and
he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of
different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph
of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand
and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his
uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the
front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and
the stairs where they began their way down below.

“Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have
kept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and
set off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see”, he said to
the chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being
a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn’t
earn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you
report everything accurately, then? It’s quite possible for someone to
be temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right time to
remember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on,
once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all
the more diligence and concentration. You’re well aware that I’m
seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my
parents and my sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation,
but I will work my way out of it again. Please don’t make things any
harder for me than they are already, and don’t take sides against me at
the office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn
an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That’s just
prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But
you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in
fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss
himself—it’s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes
about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And
you’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year
away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip
and chance and groundless complaints, and it’s almost impossible to
defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t usually even hear
about them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted from a
trip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects of what’s been going
on without even knowing what caused them. Please, don’t go away, at
least first say something to show that you grant that I’m at least
partly right!”

반대로 그레고르는 훨씬 더 차분해졌다. 그들은 더 이상 그의 말을 이해할 수 없었지만, 그에게는 충분히 명확하게 들렸다—아마 그의 귀가 그 소리에 익숙해졌을 것이다. 그들은 그에게 무언가 잘못되었다는 것을 깨달았고, 도울 준비가 되어 있었다. 그의 상황에 대한 첫 번째 반응은 자신감 있고 현명했고, 그것은 그를 더 기분 좋게 만들었다. 그는 자신이 사람들 사이로 다시 끌려 들어왔다고 느꼈고, 의사와 자물쇠 수리공에게서 그는 위대하고 놀라운 업적을 기대했다—비록 그가 그들을 실제로 구분하지는 못했지만. 다음에 무슨 말이 나올지가 중요했기 때문에, 목소리를 최대한 명확하게 하기 위해 그는 조금 기침을 했지만, 너무 크게 하지 않도록 조심했다. 인간이 기침하는 방식과 다를 수도 있고, 그는 더 이상 그것을 스스로 판단할 수 없다는 것을 확신하지 못했기 때문이다. 한편, 옆 방은 매우 조용해졌다. 아마 부모님은 주임 사무원과 함께 식탁에 앉아 속삭이고 있거나, 아니면 모두 문에 바싹 붙어 듣고 있을 것이다.

그레고르는 의자를 이용하여 문으로 천천히 몸을 밀었다. 거기에 도착하자 그는 의자를 놓고 문에 몸을 던졌고, 다리 끝의 접착력을 이용하여 문에 똑바로 서 있었다. 그는 노력으로 인한 피로를 회복하기 위해 잠시 쉬었다가, 입으로 자물쇠의 열쇠를 돌리는 일에 착수했다. 그는 불행히도 적절한 이빨이 없는 것 같았다—그렇다면 어떻게 열쇠를 잡을 수 있을까?—하지만 이빨이 없는 것은 물론 매우 강력한 턱으로 보충되었다. 턱을 사용하여 그는 갈색 액체가 그의 입에서 나와 열쇠 위로 흘러 바닥으로 떨어지는 것을 무시하고 열쇠를 돌리기 시작할 수 있었다. “들어봐,” 옆 방에 있는 주임 사무원이 말했다. “그가 열쇠를 돌리고 있어.” 그레고르는 이 말에 큰 격려를 받았다. 하지만 그들 모두가 그를 불러야 했다. 아버지와 어머니도 마찬가지다. “잘했어, 그레고르,” 그들은 외쳐야 했다. “계속해, 자물쇠를 잡아!” 그리고 그들이 그의 노력을 흥분해서 따라오고 있다

Key Term Translations:
Gregor: 그레고르
father: 아버지
maid: 하녀
mother: 어머니
sister: 누나/언니/여동생

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style

*   **Overall Tone:** The narrative tone is predominantly objective and descriptive, bordering on melancholic.  It maintains a detached, almost clinical observation of Gregor's situation and his family's reactions, yet subtly conveys the pathos of his condition and the family's struggle. The narrative voice avoids overt judgment, allowing the reader to draw their own conclusions.  This can be described as a subdued (절제된) and slightly somber (침울한) 문어체 (formal written style).

*   **Key Literary Devices:** The key literary device is the use of detailed, almost microscopic description, particularly regarding Gregor's movements and the family's actions. This meticulous description builds a sense of claustrophobia and emphasizes the physical limitations imposed on Gregor.  The narrative also subtly employs irony, contrasting Gregor's internal state (his attempts at self-entertainment, his desire to see his mother) with the external reality (his insect form, his family's anxieties).  Internal monologue is present, particularly from Gregor's perspective.


### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Gregor's Sister**
    *   **Speaking to:** Mother, implicitly to Gregor
    *   **Context/Emotion:**  Practical and somewhat strained, attempting to reassure her mother and manage the situation around Gregor.  She shows a mix of concern for her mother and practicality in dealing with the situation.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use a relatively informal 해요체 (haeyo style), reflecting her close relationship with her mother and the stressful domestic situation.  The tone should be calm and reassuring to her mother, yet subtly tinged with underlying anxiety.  Avoid excessively formal language.

*   **Character: Gregor's Mother**
    *   **Speaking to:** Sister, implicitly to Gregor
    *   **Speaking to:** (Implicitly to Gregor)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Her initial joy at seeing Gregor is quickly replaced by a mixture of pity, concern, and a deep sense of helplessness.  She expresses a maternal protectiveness and reluctance to alter Gregor's room. Her speech reflects her emotional turmoil and a hesitant, almost whispered tone when speaking implicitly to Gregor, suggesting a mixture of fear and empathy.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use a hesitant and gentle 해요체 (haeyo style) when speaking to her daughter.  When addressing Gregor (implicitly), employ a very soft, almost whispered tone, reflecting her deep concern and uncertainty about his understanding.  The sentence structure should be simpler and more emotionally charged than her dialogue with her daughter.  The overall tone should convey maternal warmth and deep empathy, even amidst her fear and uncertainty.  Consider using softer sentence-ending particles like요 (yo) and 어요 (eoyo) to further emphasize the gentleness and hesitancy.

*   **Character: No other characters directly speak in this segment.**  However, the narrative voice itself reflects the emotional weight of the scene, which should be carefully rendered in Korean.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
One day, about a month after Gregor’s transformation when his sister no
longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she
came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still
staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most
horrible. In itself, his sister’s not coming into the room would have
been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to
immediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did
she not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her,
a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite
her. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course,
but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she
seemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still
found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she
probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little
bit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to
spare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet
over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely
covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent
down. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to
do was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no
pleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely. She left the
sheet where it was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude
one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how
his sister liked the new arrangement.

For the first fourteen days, Gregor’s parents could not bring
themselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them
say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even
though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless
and frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father
and mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor’s room
while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again
she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor
had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any
slight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and
visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first
persuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and
approved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which
made her call out: “Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!
Can’t you understand I have to see him?”, and Gregor would think to
himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every
day of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand
everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was
still just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult’s
appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.

그는 종종 밤새도록 거기에 누워 잠을 자지 않고 몇 시간 동안 가죽을 긁었다. 아니면 의자를 창가로 밀고, 창틀 위로 올라가, 의자에 기대어 창밖을 내다보는 수고를 할 수도 있었다. 그는 이것을 통해 큰 자유를 느꼈지만, 지금 하는 것은 분명히 경험하는 것보다 기억하는 것이 더 많았다. 이런 방식으로 실제로 보는 것이 매일 점점 더 흐릿해지고 있었기 때문이다. 매우 가까운 것조차도 말이다. 그는 길 건너 병원의 늘 있는 전망을 저주하곤 했지만, 이제는 전혀 볼 수 없었고, 자신이 도시 한가운데에 있지만 조용한 거리인 샬로텐슈트라세에 살고 있다는 것을 알지 못했다면, 그는 회색 하늘과 회색 땅이 불가분하게 섞여 있는 황량한 황야를 창밖으로 내다보고 있다고 생각했을 것이다. 관찰력이 뛰어난 여동생은 의자를 두 번만 보면 방을 정리한 후 항상 창가의 정확한 위치로 다시 밀어 넣었고, 그 후로는 창문의 안쪽 창문도 열어 두었다.

그레고르가 여동생과 이야기하고 그를 위해 해야 할 모든 일에 대해 감사할 수 있었다면 더 견디기 쉬웠을 텐데, 그렇지 않아서 고통스러웠다. 여동생은 당연히 가능한 한 그것이 번거로운 일이 아니라고 가장하려고 노력했고, 시간이 지날수록 물론 더 잘 할 수 있었지만, 시간이 지남에 따라 그레고르도 그것을 더 잘 간파할 수 있었다. 이제 그녀가 방에 들어올 때마다 매우 불쾌해졌다. 그녀가 들어오자마자 그녀는 재빨리 문을 닫았다. 아무도 그레고르의 방을 들여다보는 것을 겪지 않도록 하기 위해서였다. 그런 다음 그녀는 곧바로 창문으로 가서 마치 숨이 막히는 것처럼 서둘러 열었다. 춥더라도 그녀는 창문
