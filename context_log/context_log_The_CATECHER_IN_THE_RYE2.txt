Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style

*   **Overall Tone:** This segment consists of the book title, author, and dedication. The tone should be **formal, concise, and direct (간결하고 직접적)**, characteristic of a book's front matter. It is purely informational and dedicatory, not narrative prose from the story itself. It should be presented in a **문어체 (written style)** appropriate for a published work's introductory elements. While the dedication "TO MY MOTHER" is personal, its presentation is brief and respectful, maintaining a formal dedication tone rather than an intimate, conversational one.
*   **Key Literary Devices:** None. This segment serves a functional purpose (identifying the book, author, and dedicatee) and does not employ literary devices like irony, metaphor, or internal monologue.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** 구어체(Colloquial style)를 기반으로 한 독백/내러티브. 형식에 얽매이지 않고 자유로우며, 마치 친한 친구에게 이야기하듯이 솔직하고 거침없는 어조를 유지해야 합니다. 냉소적이고 불평이 많으며, 세상에 대한 불만이 내재된 사춘기 청소년의 목소리를 담아내야 합니다. 가끔씩은 유머러스하거나 경멸적인 태도가 드러납니다. 전반적으로 문어체적 딱딱함보다는 대화체의 생동감을 살리는 것이 중요합니다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **의식의 흐름(Stream of Consciousness):** 화자의 생각이 자유롭게 넘나들며, 비약적이거나 즉흥적인 서술 방식을 유지합니다. 이는 한국어 번역에서도 문장 간의 유기적 연결보다는 화자의 내면 흐름을 따르는 방식으로 나타내야 합니다.
    *   **구어적 표현 및 속어(Colloquialisms & Slang):** "crap," "lousy," "goddam," "crumby," "hotshot," "strictly for the birds," "faggy," "killed me" 등 비속어와 구어적 표현들이 다수 사용되므로, 한국어에서 비슷한 연령대와 감성을 가진 화자가 사용할 법한 자연스럽고 적절한 비속어/속어로 번역하여 날것의 느낌을 살립니다. (예: "crap"은 "개소리," "헛소리," "hotshot guy"는 "잘난 놈," "난 놈," "strictly for the birds"는 "개수작," "쓸데없는 소리"). 특히 "faggy"와 같이 현재는 기피되는 용어의 경우, 화자의 불완전하고 미성숙한 시선을 드러내면서도 번역본의 문화적 수용성을 고려한 섬세한 처리가 필요합니다.
    *   **냉소와 비꼬는 어조(Sarcasm & Cynicism):** 부모, 할리우드, 펜시 프렙의 선전 문구 등 전반적으로 세상을 비판하고 비꼬는 듯한 어조가 일관되게 나타나므로, 이를 한국어에서도 효과적으로 전달할 수 있도록 어휘와 문장 구조를 선택합니다. (예: D.B.를 "being a prostitute"라고 표현하는 부분은 단순히 '창녀'가 아닌, '영혼을 팔았다'는 식의 비유적이고 냉소적인 의미를 전달할 수 있도록 번역).
    *   **과장법(Hyperbole):** "two hemorrhages apiece," "commit suicide or something," "damn near four thousand bucks" 등 과장된 표현을 통해 화자의 감정이나 상황을 극적으로 전달하므로, 한국어에서도 비슷한 효과를 주는 과장된 어법을 사용합니다.
    *   **반복 및 구어적 추임새(Repetition & Filler Words):** "and all," "or anything," "I mean" 등 구어적인 추임새나 반복이 자주 등장하여 이야기의 자연스러움과 화자의 특징을 나타내므로, 한국어에서도 이와 유사한 어미나 조사(예: "-고 말이야," "-랄까," "-는 거지," "-다던가")를 활용하여 유창하고 산만한 느낌을 살립니다.
    *   **독자에게 직접 말 거는 방식(Direct Address to Reader):** "If you really want to hear about it," "You probably heard of it" 등 독자에게 직접 말을 거는 듯한 표현이 많으므로, 이 부분을 살려 친밀감과 일방적인 대화의 느낌을 유지합니다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines
*   **Character: 홀든 콜필드 (Holden Caulfield) - 화자**
    *   **Speaking to:** 독자 (암시된 청자, 혹은 자신에게 이야기하는 독백)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 염세적이고 냉소적이며, 세상과 사람들에 대해 불만이 많고 지쳐있는 상태. 자신의 이야기를 솔직하게 털어놓으면서도 특정 부분(부모, 과거)에 대해서는 회피하려는 태도를 보인다. 전반적으로 거침없고, 비난조이며, 때로는 과장된 표현을 사용한다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   **주된 어조:** 독자와의 친밀한 거리감을 바탕으로 한 **해라체 (Hae-ra-che)**를 기본으로 사용합니다. 이는 명령형 '해라'가 아닌, 서술형 '한다/이다/있다', 의문형 '하냐/이냐/있냐' 등 편하고 격식 없는 구어적인 해라체를 의미합니다. 마치 가까운 친구에게 이야기하듯이 편안하고 솔직한 어조를 유지해야 합니다.
        *   **구체적 적용:**
            *   **비속어/속어:** 'goddam', 'hell', 'damn' 등 강한 표현은 '젠장', '빌어먹을', '개-' 접두사 등 한국어에서 홀든의 연령과 성격에 맞는 적절한 비속어 또는 강조 표현으로 번역하여 화자의 거친 감정을 드러냅니다.
            *   **강조 및 추임새:** 'and all', 'I mean' 등은 '-고 말이야', '-랄까', '-는 거지' 와 같은 구어적 표현으로 번역하여 문장의 흐름을 자연스럽고 홀든답게 만듭니다.
            *   **직접적인 어조:** 'if you want to know the truth', 'You probably heard of it' 등 독자에게 직접 말을 거는 부분은 '솔직히 말하면', '아마 들어봤을 걸', '알겠냐' 와 같이 편안한 해라체로 유지하여 독자와의 거리를 가깝게 설정합니다.
            *   **냉소적 표현:** 'prostitute' (영화 산업에 대한 비유)와 같은 표현은 직역보다는 '영혼을 팔았다', '타락했다' 등 홀든의 비판적 시각을 드러내는 의역을 고려합니다.
            *   **문장 구조:** 간결하면서도 주저함이나 망설임, 생각의 전환이 느껴지는 문장 구조를 사용하여 홀든의 내면을 표현합니다.

*   **No other dialogue in this segment.**

### AI-Generated Guidelines Used:
Key Term Translations:
Anthony Wayne Avenue: 앤서니 웨인 애비뉴
Holden: 홀든
Mr. Zambesi: 잠베시 씨
Mrs. Spencer: 스펜서 부인

Spencer: 스펜서
Thurmer: 써머

Style and Tone Analysis:
Here are the guidelines for translating the provided text segment, focusing on consistent tone and speaking style.

### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is informal, highly colloquial, and deeply personal, delivered in a stream-of-consciousness manner as if Holden is speaking directly to a close peer. His voice is characterized by a cynical yet vulnerable undertone, frequent interjections, and a conversational, sometimes rambling, flow. The Korean translation should primarily employ **해라체 (Haera-che)** to capture this raw, unfiltered, and direct speaking style. However, it is not a neutral or dry 해라체; it must convey Holden's distinct personality, including his sarcasm, exaggerations, and emotional shifts. The language should reflect a rebellious, slightly jaded teenage perspective.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Stream of Consciousness:** Maintain the associative, often disjointed, flow of thoughts. The pacing should feel natural and unpolished, reflecting how thoughts might spontaneously arise and shift.
    *   **Colloquialism & Slang:** This is crucial to Holden's authentic voice. Translate phrases like "kicked me out," "get the ax," "cold as a witch's teat," "freezing my ass off," "goddam," "crooks," "no wind," "damn near fell down" using Korean equivalents that evoke a similar informal, youthful, and slightly defiant register. Avoid formal or overly refined vocabulary.
    *   **Direct Address to Reader:** Preserve instances where Holden directly addresses the implied reader (e.g., "I forgot to tell you about that," "if you want to know the truth"). This strengthens the conversational tone.
    *   **Repetitive Phrases/Verbal Tics:** Consistently translate Holden's recurring phrases like "Anyway," "and all," "I mean." These give his narration a distinctive rhythm and conversational authenticity.
    *   **Hyperbole & Understatement:** Convey his characteristic exaggerations (e.g., "freezing my ass off," "icy as hell") and occasional understatements to reflect his unique way of perceiving and describing events.
    *   **Cynicism & Sarcasm:** Clearly express Holden's cynical observations, especially regarding Pencey and its students (e.g., "The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has—I'm not kidding.").

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden (speaking to himself/aloud in desperation)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Self (expressing an internal thought aloud due to urgency/impatience)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Freezing cold, desperate to get inside Spencer's house, impatient for someone to open the door.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use a very informal, exclamatory **해라체 (Haera-che)** or a direct, imperative, and urgent tone suitable for a frustrated thought spoken aloud.
        *   "C'mon, c'mon": "빨리, 빨리," or "어서, 어서" (with an urgent intonation).
        *   "somebody open the door": "누가 문 좀 열어봐" or "누가 문 좀 열어줘."

*   **Character: Mrs. Spencer**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Warm, affectionate, welcoming, and genuinely concerned for Holden's well-being. She clearly has a fondness for him.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use a polite yet warm and familiar **해요체 (Haeyo-che)** as the base, but incorporate endearing terms or slightly more familiar imperatives common from older, affectionate women towards younger individuals they care for.
        *   "Holden! How lovely to see you!": "홀든! 어서 와요!" or "홀든! 반갑구나!" (The latter, while 하게체, conveys a natural warmth from an elder).
        *   "Come in, dear!": "들어와요, 얘야!" (해요체 + endearing term) or "들어오렴, 얘야!" (하게체 + endearing term, which is very natural for this context).
        *   "Are you frozen to death?": "얼어 죽겠니?" (A natural, concerned question using a slightly informal but caring ending, appropriate for an elder to a younger person they know well).

 If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is
where I was born, an what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were
occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I
don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff
bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece
if I told anything pretty personal about them. They're quite touchy about anything like
that, especially my father. They're nice and all--I'm not saying that--but they're also
touchy as hell. Besides, I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or
anything. I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last
Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy. I
mean that's all I told D.B. about, and he's my brother and all. He's in Hollywood. That
isn't too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every
week end. He's going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe. He just got a
Jaguar. One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour. It
cost him damn near four thousand bucks. He's got a lot of dough, now. He didn't use to. He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home. He wrote this terrific book of
short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him. The best one in it was
"The Secret Goldfish." It was about this little kid that wouldn't let anybody look at his
goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money. It killed me. Now he's out in
Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies. Don't even
mention them to me. Where I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep. Pencey Prep is this
school that's in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. You probably heard of it. You've probably seen
the ads, anyway. They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some
hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence. Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was
play polo all the time. I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place. And
underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always says: "Since 1888 we have been
molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men." Strictly for the birds. They don't
do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school. And I didn't know
anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all. Maybe two guys. If that
many. And they probably came to Pencey that way. Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall. The game
with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey. It was the last game
of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn't
win. I remember around three o'clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell up on
top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War
and all. You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams
bashing each other all over the place. You couldn't see the grandstand too hot, but you
could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the
whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side,
because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them. There were never many girls at all at the football games. Only seniors were
allowed to bring girls with them. It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it. I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while, even
if they're only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or
something. Old Selma Thurmer--she was the headmaster's daughter--showed up at the
games quite often, but she wasn't exactly the type that drove you mad with desire. She
was a pretty nice girl, though. I sat next to her once in the bus from Agerstown and we
sort of struck up a conversation. I liked her. She had a big nose and her nails were all
bitten down and bleedy-looking and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the
place, but you felt sort of sorry for her. What I liked about her, she didn't give you a lot of
horse manure about what a great guy her father was. She probably knew what a phony
slob he was. The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game,
was because I'd just got back from New York with the fencing team. I was the goddam
manager of the fencing team. Very big deal. We'd gone in to New York that morning for
this fencing meet with McBurney School. Only, we didn't have the meet. I left all the
foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway. It wasn't all my fault. I had to keep
getting up to look at this map, so we'd know where to get off. So we got back to Pencey
around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime. The whole team ostracized me the whole
way back on the train. It was pretty funny, in a way. The other reason I wasn't down at the game was because I was on my way to say
good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher.

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
내가 경기를 보지 않고 톰슨 언덕 꼭대기에 서 있었던 건, 펜싱 팀이랑 뉴욕에서 막 돌아왔기 때문이야. 나는 빌어먹을 펜싱 팀 매니저였거든. 뭐 대단한 일이지. 맥버니 학교랑 펜싱 시합이 있어서 그날 아침 뉴욕에 갔었어. 그런데 시합을 못 했어. 빌어먹을 지하철에 플뢰레랑 장비 같은 걸 다 두고 내렸거든. 다 내 잘못은 아니었어. 우리가 어디서 내려야 하는지 알려고 계속 일어서서 지도를 봐야 했단 말이야. 그래서 저녁 식사 시간쯤이 아니라 두시 반쯤에 펜시로 돌아왔어. 기차로 돌아오는 내내 팀 전체가 나를 왕따 시켰지. 어떤 면에서는 꽤 웃겼어.

내가 경기에 가지 않은 또 다른 이유는 스펜서 영감님, 그러니까 내 역사 선생님한테 작별 인사를 하러 가는 길이었기 때문이야.

### 1. Narration Style

*   **Overall Tone:** 홀든 콜필드의 개인적인 독백이자 독자에게 직접 이야기를 건네는 듯한 **구어체적이고 비격식적인 어조**를 유지해야 합니다. 냉소적이고 관찰적이며, 때로는 무심하거나 비판적인 십대 특유의 의식의 흐름을 반영해야 합니다. 문어체의 딱딱함보다는 대화체의 유연함과 생동감을 살리며, 마치 친구에게 이야기를 들려주는 듯한 느낌을 줍니다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **1인칭 시점:** 홀든의 주관적인 시각과 감정을 직접적으로 전달하기 위해 1인칭 서술을 일관되게 유지합니다. "-다/는" 또는 "-았/었다"와 같은 어미를 사용하여 독백 또는 회상하는 듯한 느낌을 줍니다.
    *   **구어체 및 속어:** "old as hell," "hot-shots," "my ass" 등 홀든의 특성을 나타내는 속어와 비격식적인 표현을 한국어의 적절한 구어체나 은어, 비속어로 번역하여 홀든의 반항적이고 불완전한 캐릭터를 살립니다. 지나치게 정제되거나 고상한 표현은 피합니다.
    *   **삽입구/부가 설명:** "in my opinion," "You know"와 같은 홀든의 독백적 삽입구와 군말은 자연스러운 한국어 표현으로 옮겨 독자와의 친밀감을 형성합니다.
    *   **반복:** 스펜서의 말("Life is a game...")을 홀든이 비꼬듯이 반복하는 부분 등, 반복을 통해 캐릭터의 어조와 강조를 살립니다.
    *   **풍자/냉소:** "Game, my ass. Some game."과 같은 홀든의 냉소적인 태도를 한국어로도 효과적으로 전달하기 위해 어휘 선택과 문장 구조에 주의를 기울입니다. 특히 홀든의 짜증이나 불만을 표현하는 문장은 간결하고 직설적으로 번역합니다.
    *   **감각적 묘사:** "Vicks Nose Drops 냄새," "울퉁불퉁한 가슴," "하얗고 털 없는 다리" 등 감각적인 묘사를 생생하게 번역하여 홀든의 관찰력을 보여줍니다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: 홀든 (Holden Caulfield)**
    *   **Speaking to: 스펜서 (Old Spencer)**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** 나이 많고 병든 선생님에 대한 기본적인 예의와 존경심은 유지하되, 내면적으로는 다소 귀찮고 무심한 태도를 드러냅니다. 답변은 대체로 짧고 간결합니다.
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 존칭을 사용하는 **하십시오체** 또는 **해요체**를 기본으로 하되, 홀든 특유의 무심하고 건조한 어조를 반영하여 과도한 공손함이나 친근함은 피합니다. 예를 들어, "Hello, sir,"는 "안녕하세요, 선생님." 또는 "안녕하십니까."로, "Yes, sir."는 "네, 선생님." 또는 "예, 선생님."으로 번역합니다. 질문이나 대답은 예의를 갖추되 홀든의 성격에 맞게 담담하게 표현합니다.
    *   **Speaking to: Self (Internal Monologue)**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** 독백, 강한 불평, 불만, 냉소적인 비판. 필터링되지 않은 솔직한 생각.
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 가장 비격식적이고 직설적인 **해체 (반말)**를 사용합니다. "Game, my ass. Some game."과 같은 표현은 한국어의 적절한 비속어나 거친 표현을 사용하여 홀든의 강한 불만과 냉소를 그대로 전달합니다.

*   **Character: 스펜서 (Old Spencer)**
    *   **Speaking to: 홀든 (Holden Caulfield)**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** 나이 많은 교사로서 학생인 홀든에게 보이는 권위적이고, 때로는 훈계조이며, 때로는 애정을 담은 듯한 복합적인 태도를 보입니다. 병들고 노쇠한 상태에서 나오는 말투의 특징(예: 다소 고함 지르듯, 중얼거리듯, 자주 끄덕이는 행동)을 반영해야 합니다.
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 연장자나 상사가 아랫사람에게 사용하는 **해라체**를 주된 어조로 사용합니다. 다만, 딱딱하거나 차가운 해라체가 아니라, 'boy'나 'm'boy'와 같은 애칭을 통해 느껴지는 다소 정겹고 허물없는, 또는 나이 든 사람 특유의 푸근하면서도 잔소리 같은 느낌을 살립니다.
            *   "Who's that?" "Come in, boy."와 같이 처음에는 다소 고함치듯 시작하나, 이후에는 "Have a seat there, boy," "M'boy, if I felt any better I'd have to send for the doctor," "So you're leaving us, eh?" "What did Dr. Thurmer say to you, boy?" 처럼 자연스러운 해라체를 사용합니다.
            *   "Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules." 같은 훈계조의 대사는 해라체를 통해 권위와 메시지의 무게감을 전달하되, 스펜서의 병약하고 다소 기이한 면모가 드러나도록 문장의 리듬을 조절할 수 있습니다.
            *   "He started chuckling like a madman."이나 "nodding routine" 등 스펜서의 행동 묘사를 참고하여 대사의 전달 방식에도 노쇠함과 기이함이 은근히 드러나도록 합니다.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
He had the grippe, and I figured I probably
wouldn't see him again till Christmas vacation started. He wrote me this note saying he
wanted to see me before I went home. He knew I wasn't coming back to Pencey. I forgot to tell you about that. They kicked me out. I wasn't supposed to come
back after Christmas vacation on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying
myself and all. They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself--especially
around midterms, when my parents came up for a conference with old Thurmer--but I
didn't do it. So I got the ax. They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey. It has a
very good academic rating, Pencey. It really does. Anyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch's teat, especially on
top of that stupid hill. I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything. The week
before that, somebody'd stolen my camel's-hair coat right out of my room, with my furlined gloves right in the pocket and all. Pencey was full of crooks. Quite a few guys came
from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway. The more expensive a
school is, the more crooks it has--I'm not kidding. Anyway, I kept standing next to that
crazy cannon, looking down at the game and freezing my ass off. Only, I wasn't watching
the game too much. What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind
of a good-by. I mean I've left schools and places I didn't even know I was leaving them. I
hate that. I don't care if it's a sad good-by or a bad goodby, but when I leave a place I like
to know I'm leaving it. If you don't, you feel even worse. I was lucky. All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I
was getting the hell out. I suddenly remembered this time, in around October, that I and
Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around, in front of the
academic building. They were nice guys, especially Tichener. It was just before dinner
and it was getting pretty dark out, but we kept chucking the ball around anyway. It kept
getting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball any more, but we didn't want
to stop doing what we were doing. Finally we had to. This teacher that taught biology,
Mr. Zambesi, stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to
go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner. If I get a chance to remember that kind of
stuff, I can get a good-by when I need one--at least, most of the time I can. As soon as I
got it, I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill, toward old
Spencer's house. He didn't live on the campus. He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue. I ran all the way to the main gate, and then I waited a second till I got my breath. I
have no wind, if you want to know the truth. I'm quite a heavy smoker, for one thing--that
is, I used to be. They made me cut it out. Another thing, I grew six and a half inches last
year. That's also how I practically got t.b. and came out here for all these goddam
checkups and stuff. I'm pretty healthy, though. Anyway, as soon as I got my breath back I ran across Route 204. It was icy as hell
and I damn near fell down. I don't even know what I was running for--I guess I just felt
like it. After I got across the road, I felt like I was sort of disappearing. It was that kind of
a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were
disappearing every time you crossed a road. Boy, I rang that doorbell fast when I got to old Spencer's house. I was really
frozen. My ears were hurting and I could hardly move my fingers at all. "C'mon, c'mon,"
I said right out loud, almost, "somebody open the door." Finally old Mrs. Spencer
opened. it. They didn't have a maid or anything, and they always opened the door
themselves. They didn't have too much dough. "Holden!" Mrs. Spencer said. "How lovely to see you! Come in, dear! Are you
frozen to death?" I think she was glad to see me. She liked me. At least, I think she did. Boy, did I get in that house fast. "How are you, Mrs. Spencer?" I said. "How's Mr. Spencer?"
 "Let me take your coat, dear," she said. She didn't hear me ask her how Mr. Spencer was. She was sort of deaf. She hung up my coat in the hall closet, and I sort of brushed my hair back with
my hand. I wear a crew cut quite frequently and I never have to comb it much. "How've
you been, Mrs. Spencer?" I said again, only louder, so she'd hear me. "I've been just fine, Holden." She closed the closet door. "How have you been?"
The way she asked me, I knew right away old Spencer'd told her I'd been kicked out. "Fine," I said. "How's Mr. Spencer? He over his grippe yet?"
 "Over it! Holden, he's behaving like a perfect--I don't know what. . . He's in his
room, dear. Go right in."

 They each had their own room and all. They were both around seventy years old,
or even more than that. They got a bang out of things, though--in a haif-assed way, of
course. I know that sounds mean to say, but I don't mean it mean. I just mean that I used
to think about old Spencer quite a lot, and if you thought about him too much, you
wondered what the heck he was still living for.

Style and Tone Analysis:
Here are the guidelines for the translator:

### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is informal, highly personal, and conversational, reflecting the stream of consciousness of a cynical and rebellious teenager (Holden Caulfield). It should feel like a direct monologue delivered by the narrator to the reader, often with an underlying tone of annoyance, disgust, or sarcasm. This aligns with a **구어체 (spoken language style)** rather than a formal **문어체 (written literary style)**.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Internal Monologue:** Preserve the sense of Holden's thoughts unfolding in real-time.
    *   **Direct Address (implied):** When Holden addresses the reader (e.g., "Boy, you can't imagine..."), maintain the informal, direct connection.
    *   **Sarcasm and Cynicism:** These are central to Holden's voice. Ensure his dry wit and critical observations are clearly conveyed.
    *   **Colloquialisms and Repetition:** Maintain the natural, sometimes rambling, flow of his speech and the emphasis created by repetition (e.g., "Absolutely nothing").

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Narrator (Holden Caulfield)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Self (internal thoughts) and implied reader.
    *   **Context/Emotion:** His internal thoughts and narration convey a wide range of emotions: disgust (nose-picking), cynicism (word "grand"), extreme annoyance (impending lecture, Spencer's habits), frustration (failing school), self-pity (hard bed), and rebellious contempt (Spencer's "dirty trick" and lecture).
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** For Holden's narration and internal thoughts, use a consistently informal and highly personal **해체 (hae-che)**. This choice authentically captures his adolescent voice, his directness, cynicism, and frequent use of colloquialisms. Ensure it conveys a teenage, slightly rebellious, and world-weary tone rather than sounding childish. When he directly addresses the reader (e.g., "Boy, you can't imagine how sorry I was getting..."), maintain this **해체** for consistency.

*   **Character: Old Spencer**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden Caulfield.
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Spencer is an older, authoritative teacher. His tone shifts from initially somewhat patronizing and formal ("I had the privilege of meeting your mother and dad...") to stern, disappointed, and increasingly sarcastic as he lectures Holden about his academic failures. He is trying to impart a lesson through admonishment.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Spencer's speech should reflect his age, authority, and varying emotional states:
        *   For initial formal or polite-sounding statements (e.g., "I had the privilege..."), use a formal **하십시오체 (hasipsio-che)** to convey his established persona.
        *   When lecturing, questioning, or expressing disappointment and sarcasm, primarily use a condescending **해라체 (hae-ra-che)**. This will convey his power dynamic over Holden and his critical, sometimes harsh, and often sarcastic tone (e.g., "What's the matter with you, boy?", "Tell the truth, boy.", "You glanced through it, eh?", "Your essay, shall we say, ends there,").
        *   A subtle blend with **하십시오체** can be used for specific formal questions or polite-sounding but rhetorical/sarcastic requests (e.g., "How many subjects did you carry this term?", "Bring it here, please.", "Would you care to hear what you had to say?"). The *하십시오체* here should carry an underlying tone of authority or veiled sarcasm, not genuine politeness. This blend effectively portrays his complex character as a disappointed teacher.

*   **Character: Holden (in dialogue)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Old Spencer.
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Holden is outwardly respectful and submissive (using "sir"), but inwardly he is annoyed, defiant, and resigned. His replies are often terse, factual, or defensive, delivered with a sense of begrudging politeness.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use a respectful but simple **해요체 (hae-yo-che)**. This speech level appropriately conveys a student's respect for a teacher (indicated by "sir") while still feeling natural and fitting for a teenager's dialogue. Avoid overly formal **하십시오체** for his replies, as it would sound unnatural for his character and age, especially given his internal rebellion. Examples: "Five, sir." "Four." "I passed English all right..." "I know that, sir. Boy, I know it. You couldn't help it." "No, sir, not very much."

### Immediate Context Used (English):
I mean he was all stooped over, and he
had very terrible posture, and in class, whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the
blackboard, some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to
him. That's awful, in my opinion. But if you thought about him just enough and not too
much, you could figure it out that he wasn't doing too bad for himself. For instance, one
Sunday when some other guys and I were over there for hot chocolate, he showed us this
old beat-up Navajo blanket that he and Mrs. Spencer'd bought off some Indian in
Yellowstone Park. You could tell old Spencer'd got a big bang out of buying it. That's
what I mean. You take somebody old as hell, like old Spencer, and they can get a big
bang out of buying a blanket. His door was open, but I sort of knocked on it anyway, just to be polite and all. I
could see where he was sitting. He was sitting in a big leather chair, all wrapped up in
that blanket I just told you about. He looked over at me when I knocked. "Who's that?" he
yelled. "Caulfield? Come in, boy." He was always yelling, outside class. It got on your
nerves sometimes. The minute I went in, I was sort of sorry I'd come. He was reading the Atlantic
Monthly, and there were pills and medicine all over the place, and everything smelled
like Vicks Nose Drops. It was pretty depressing. I'm not too crazy about sick people,
anyway. What made it even more depressing, old Spencer had on this very sad, ratty old
bathrobe that he was probably born in or something. I don't much like to see old guys in
their pajamas and bathrobes anyway. Their bumpy old chests are always showing. And
their legs. Old guys' legs, at beaches and places, always look so white and unhairy. "Hello, sir," I said. "I got your note. Thanks a lot." He'd written me this note asking me to
stop by and say good-by before vacation started, on account of I wasn't coming back. "You didn't have to do all that. I'd have come over to say good-by anyway."
 "Have a seat there, boy," old Spencer said. He meant the bed. I sat down on it. "How's your grippe, sir?"
 "M'boy, if I felt any better I'd have to send for the doctor," old Spencer said. That
knocked him out. He started chuckling like a madman. Then he finally straightened
himself out and said, "Why aren't you down at the game? I thought this was the day of the
big game."
 "It is. I was. Only, I just got back from New York with the fencing team," I said. Boy, his bed was like a rock. He started getting serious as hell. I knew he would. "So you're leaving us, eh?" he
said. "Yes, sir. I guess I am."
 He started going into this nodding routine. You never saw anybody nod as much
in your life as old Spencer did. You never knew if he was nodding a lot because he was
thinking and all, or just because he was a nice old guy that didn't know his ass from his
elbow. "What did Dr. Thurmer say to you, boy? I understand you had quite a little chat."
 "Yes, we did. We really did. I was in his office for around two hours, I guess."
 "What'd he say to you?"
 "Oh. . . well, about Life being a game and all. And how you should play it
according to the rules. He was pretty nice about it. I mean he didn't hit the ceiling or
anything. He just kept talking about Life being a game and all. You know."
 "Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules."
 "Yes, sir. I know it is. I know it."
 Game, my ass. Some game. If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are, then
it's a game, all right--I'll admit that. But if you get on the other side, where there aren't
any hot-shots, then what's a game about it? Nothing. No game. "Has Dr. Thurmer written
to your parents yet?" old Spencer asked me. "He said he was going to write them Monday."
 "Have you yourself communicated with them?"
 "No, sir, I haven't communicated with them, because I'll probably see them
Wednesday night when I get home."
 "And how do you think they'll take the news?"
 "Well. . . they'll be pretty irritated about it," I said. "They really will. This is about
the fourth school I've gone to." I shook my head. I shake my head quite a lot. "Boy!" I
said. I also say "Boy!" quite a lot. Partly because I have a lousy vocabulary and partly
because I act quite young for my age sometimes. I was sixteen then, and I'm seventeen
now, and sometimes I act like I'm about thirteen. It's really ironical, because I'm six foot
two and a half and I have gray hair. I really do. The one side of my head--the right side--
is full of millions of gray hairs. I've had them ever since I was a kid. And yet I still act
sometimes like I was only about twelve. Everybody says that, especially my father. It's
partly true, too, but it isn't all true. People always think something's all true. I don't give a
damn, except that I get bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age. Sometimes I
act a lot older than I am--I really do--but people never notice it. People never notice
anything. Old Spencer started nodding again. He also started picking his nose. He made out
like he was only pinching it, but he was really getting the old thumb right in there.

"음... 꽤 짜증 내실 거예요." 내가 말했다. "정말 그럴 거예요. 여기가 벌써 네 번째 학교니까요." 나는 고개를 저었다. 나는 고개를 꽤 많이 젓는다. "젠장!" 하고 나는 말했다. "젠장!"이라는 말을 나도 꽤 많이 한다. partly because 나는 어휘력이 형편없고, partly because 가끔 내 나이보다 훨씬 어리게 행동하기 때문이다. 그때는 열여섯 살이었고 지금은 열일곱 살인데, 가끔은 열세 살쯤 되는 것처럼 행동한다. 이건 정말 아이러니한 일이다. 왜냐하면 나는 키가 6피트 2인치 반이나 되고 새치도 있기 때문이다. 정말 그렇다. 내 머리 한쪽—오른쪽—은 수백만 개의 새치로 가득하다. 어렸을 때부터 그랬다. 그런데도 나는 가끔 겨우 열두 살처럼 행동한다. 모두가 그렇게 말한다, 특히 우리 아버지가. 그것도 부분적으로는 맞지만, 전부는 아니다. 사람들은 항상 뭔가 전부 다 진실이라고 생각한다. 나는 신경 쓰지 않는다, 사람들이 나에게 나이 값 하라고 말할 때 가끔 지루하다는 것만 빼면. 가끔은 내 실제 나이보다 훨씬 더 어른스럽게 행동하기도 하는데—정말 그렇다—사람들은 그걸 절대 눈치채지 못한다. 사람들은 아무것도 눈치채지 못한다.

스펜서 영감이 다시 고개를 끄덕이기 시작했다. 그는 코도 후비기 시작했다. 코를 꼬집는 척했지만, 사실은 늙은 엄지손가락을 제대로 집어넣는 중이었다.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is characterized by Holden Caulfield's highly distinctive voice: informal, conversational, cynical, and introspective. It's a stream-of-consciousness narrative that often rambles, interspersing observations, direct thoughts, and emotional reactions. The tone should feel like a teenager confiding in a peer or journaling, rather than a formal literary account.
    *   **Recommended Narrative Style:** Primarily use **해라체 (plain style)** for general descriptions of events and Holden's internal monologues, reflecting his direct and unvarnished thoughts. However, to capture his conversational, almost confiding tone with the reader, frequently blend in **해요체 (polite informal style)**, especially when expressing opinions, making asides, or posing rhetorical questions. Avoid overly formal **문어체 (literary prose)**. Ensure the language is natural and reflects a teenager's vocabulary and rhythm, including filler words and expressions of uncertainty.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Stream of Consciousness / Internal Monologue (의식의 흐름 / 내적 독백):** Crucially preserve the sense of Holden's thoughts directly flowing onto the page, often digressing (e.g., the ducks, Mr. Haas) and interrupting his own narrative or dialogue. These digressions should feel organic to his thought process.
    *   **Colloquialisms & Slang (구어체 표현 & 비속어):** Maintain the informal and sometimes crude language ("phony," "goddam," "shoot the bull"). Translate these naturally into equivalent Korean slang or casual expressions used by teenagers, ensuring they don't sound overly aggressive unless intended.
    *   **Cynicism & Sarcasm (냉소적 & 비꼬는 어조):** Convey Holden's jaded and critical view of the adult world and "phonies." His sarcastic comments should be clearly identifiable.
    *   **Repetition:** Preserve the natural repetition of phrases (e.g., "That kind of stuff," "The old bull," "Very interested," "not too much, I guess") which characterize his speech patterns.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden Caulfield (Narrator/Speaker)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Mr. Spencer
    *   **Context/Emotion:**
        *   Initially, he's trying to appease Spencer, "shooting the bull" to feign remorse, and generally being evasive.
        *   Later, he becomes defensive, annoyed, and slightly dismissive of Spencer's advice, though he maintains a veneer of politeness.
        *   His internal thoughts often contradict his spoken words, showing his true feelings of boredom, distraction, and disdain.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   **When speaking to Mr. Spencer:** Use a respectful but slightly detached **해요체 (polite informal style)**, acknowledging Spencer's authority but conveying Holden's underlying disinterest or evasion. When directly addressing Spencer as "sir," a slightly more formal **하십시오체 (formal polite style)** might be used for the honorifics, but the overall sentence structure and content should still reflect Holden's casualness. For example, "sir" can be translated as "선생님" or "선생님 말씀이시죠" which naturally implies respect, but the rest of the sentence should remain in 해요체.
        *   **Internal Thoughts (as part of narration):** Use **해라체 (plain style)** or **해체 (intimate informal)** to convey the directness and unvarnished nature of his thoughts (e.g., "It's boring to do that every two minutes," "I sort of wished he'd cover up his bumpy chest," "I hated that goddam Elkton Hills").

*   **Character: Mr. Spencer**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden Caulfield
    *   **Context/Emotion:** An older, well-meaning but somewhat traditional and preachy teacher. He expresses genuine concern for Holden, attempting to guide him and impart "sense," but also exhibits frustration, repetition, and a paternalistic, sometimes slightly accusatory tone. He wants to be authoritative but is ultimately ineffective.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use a formal and didactic **하십시오체 (formal polite style)**. His questions and statements should convey a sense of authority, concern, and often admonition. When he says things like "You will," it should carry a firm, almost prophetic weight, which can be achieved through strong phrasing within the 하십시오체 or by a brief shift to a direct, warning-like **해라체** ending (e.g., "넌 그렇게 될 거다"). Ensure that his "nasty" or "sarcastic" moments (e.g., about other schools) are conveyed through sharp word choice and intonation within his formal speech level, rather than a shift to an informal style.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
I guess
he thought it was all right to do because it was only me that was in the room. I didn't care,
except that it's pretty disgusting to watch somebody pick their nose. Then he said, "I had the privilege of meeting your mother and dad when they had
their little chat with Dr. Thurmer some weeks ago. They're grand people."
 "Yes, they are. They're very nice."
 Grand. There's a word I really hate. It's a phony. I could puke every time I hear it. Then all of a sudden old Spencer looked like he had something very good,
something sharp as a tack, to say to me. He sat up more in his chair and sort of moved
around. It was a false alarm, though. All he did was lift the Atlantic Monthly off his lap
and try to chuck it on the bed, next to me. He missed. It was only about two inches away,
but he missed anyway. I got up and picked it up and put it down on the bed. All of a
sudden then, I wanted to get the hell out of the room. I could feel a terrific lecture coming
on. I didn't mind the idea so much, but I didn't feel like being lectured to and smell Vicks
Nose Drops and look at old Spencer in his pajamas and bathrobe all at the same time. I
really didn't. It started, all right. "What's the matter with you, boy?" old Spencer said. He said it
pretty tough, too, for him. "How many subjects did you carry this term?"
 "Five, sir."
 "Five. And how many are you failing in?"
 "Four." I moved my ass a little bit on the bed. It was the hardest bed I ever sat on. "I passed English all right," I said, "because I had all that Beowulf and Lord Randal My
Son stuff when I was at the Whooton School. I mean I didn't have to do any work in
English at all hardly, except write compositions once in a while."
 He wasn't even listening. He hardly ever listened to you when you said
something. "I flunked you in history because you knew absolutely nothing."
 "I know that, sir. Boy, I know it. You couldn't help it."
 "Absolutely nothing," he said over again. That's something that drives me crazy. When people say something twice that way, after you admit it the first time. Then he said
it three times. "But absolutely nothing. I doubt very much if you opened your textbook
even once the whole term. Did you? Tell the truth, boy."
 "Well, I sort of glanced through it a couple of times," I told him. I didn't want to
hurt his feelings. He was mad about history. "You glanced through it, eh?" he said--very sarcastic. "Your, ah, exam paper is
over there on top of my chiffonier. On top of the pile. Bring it here, please."
 It was a very dirty trick, but I went over and brought it over to him--I didn't have
any alternative or anything. Then I sat down on his cement bed again. Boy, you can't
imagine how sorry I was getting that I'd stopped by to say good-by to him. He started handling my exam paper like it was a turd or something. "We studied
the Egyptians from November 4th to December 2nd," he said. "You chose to write about
them for the optional essay question. Would you care to hear what you had to say?"
 "No, sir, not very much," I said. He read it anyway, though. You can't stop a teacher when they want to do
something. They just do it. The Egyptians were an ancient race of Caucasians residing in
 one of the northern sections of Africa. The latter as we all
 know is the largest continent in the Eastern Hemisphere. I had to sit there and listen to that crap. It certainly was a dirty trick. The Egyptians are extremely interesting to us today for
 various reasons. Modern science would still like to know what
 the secret ingredients were that the Egyptians used when they
 wrapped up dead people so that their faces would not rot for
 innumerable centuries. This interesting riddle is still quite
 a challenge to modern science in the twentieth century. He stopped reading and put my paper down. I was beginning to sort of hate him. "Your essay, shall we say, ends there," he said in this very sarcastic voice. You wouldn't
think such an old guy would be so sarcastic and all. "However, you dropped me a little
note, at the bottom of the page," he said. "I know I did," I said. I said it very fast because I wanted to stop him before he
started reading that out loud. But you couldn't stop him. He was hot as a firecracker. DEAR MR. SPENCER [he read out loud]. That is all I know about
 the Egyptians. I can't seem to get very interested in them
 although your lectures are very interesting. It is all right
 with me if you flunk me though as I am flunking everything
 else except English anyway. Respectfully yours, HOLDEN CAULFIELD. He put my goddam paper down then and looked at me like he'd just beaten hell
out of me in ping-pong or something. I don't think I'll ever forgive him for reading me
that crap out loud. I wouldn't've read it out loud to him if he'd written it--I really wouldn't. In the first place, I'd only written that damn note so that he wouldn't feel too bad about
flunking me. "Do you blame me for flunking you, boy?" he said. "No, sir! I certainly don't," I said. I wished to hell he'd stop calling me "boy" all
the time. He tried chucking my exam paper on the bed when he was through with it.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is characterized by a highly personal, informal, conversational, and stream-of-consciousness style. It's frequently cynical, sarcastic, and employs colloquialisms and mild profanity, faithfully reflecting the narrator's (Holden's) adolescent, disaffected voice. It's a blend of immediate observation and retrospective commentary, often with a critical undertone.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **First-person Internal Monologue (1인칭 내면 독백):** This is the dominant mode, revealing Holden's unfiltered thoughts, judgments, and frequent digressions.
    *   **Colloquialisms & Slang (구어체 및 비속어):** Crucial for establishing Holden's authentic voice. Words like "crap," "sad as hell," "goddam," "phony bastard," "killed me" (meaning 'it shocked/amused me greatly') need careful translation to maintain their impact and naturalness without sounding overly aggressive or artificial in Korean.
    *   **Hyperbole & Sarcasm (과장법 및 반어법):** Frequently employed (e.g., "most terrific liar," "speech that lasted about ten hours," "blew the roof off"). These should be conveyed with appropriate Korean equivalents that capture the underlying irony or exaggeration.
    *   **Digressions (탈선):** The narrative often veers off into anecdotes or personal opinions (like the Ossenburger story), which is central to Holden's character. Maintain the abrupt, conversational flow of these shifts.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Narrator (Holden Caulfield)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Mr. Spencer
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Holden is attempting to be polite, reassuring, and concerned, but primarily wants to end the conversation and leave. There's an underlying weariness and a slight disdain for the situation or Spencer's worries, masked by a facade of politeness and feigned concern. He wants to appear mature and responsible.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use **해요체 (haeyoche)** for general politeness and offers ("Please don't worry about me," "Wouldn't you like a cup of hot chocolate?"). For more direct or slightly pushy parts like "Okay?" or "I mean it, sir," maintain the 해요체 but allow for a slightly more direct or less overtly deferential nuance, reflecting his underlying impatience. His closing "I'll drop you a line, sir. Take care of your grippe, now" should also be 해요체, conveying polite concern but also a hint of finality.

*   **Character: Narrator (Holden Caulfield) - Narration/Internal Monologue**
    *   **Speaking to:** Self / Reader
    *   **Context/Emotion:** This is Holden's unfiltered, raw voice – his cynical observations, frustrations, and occasional moments of genuine sadness or reflection. He is speaking his mind, unburdened by social conventions.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Predominantly **해체 (haeche)**. This informal, direct, and often blunt style is essential for conveying Holden's genuine personality, his internal complaints, and his critical observations of the world. Incorporate colloquialisms and mild profanity (e.g., "goddam," "hell") naturally within this style to maintain authenticity. The frequent use of declarative statements and rhetorical questions ("It's awful," "I hope to hell not," "It sounds terrible, when you think about it") should be rendered in this informal, conversational voice.

*   **Character: Mr. Spencer**
    *   **Speaking to:** Narrator (Holden Caulfield)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Spencer is an older teacher, seemingly ill ("grippe") and somewhat concerned about Holden, but also practical and ready to conclude their interaction. His tone is generally kind but also reflects his authority and age.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   For his polite refusal and explanation for leaving ("I would, I really would, but the thing is, I have to get going. I have to go right to the gym. Thanks, though. Thanks a lot."), use **해요체 (haeyoche)**. This conveys politeness and a degree of respect suitable for an elder speaking to a younger person he cares for, but not overly formal.
        *   For "Good-by, boy," use **해라체 (haerache)** or a soft **하게체 (hageche)**. This is appropriate for an older male authority figure addressing a younger male, conveying a paternal or somewhat familiar, yet still authoritative, farewell. Avoid an overly harsh 해라체; aim for one that carries a sense of warmth, weariness, or resignation rather than strict command.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
Only,
he missed again, naturally. I had to get up again and pick it up and put it on top of the
Atlantic Monthly. It's boring to do that every two minutes. "What would you have done in my place?" he said. "Tell the truth, boy."
 Well, you could see he really felt pretty lousy about flunking me. So I shot the
bull for a while. I told him I was a real moron, and all that stuff. I told him how I
would've done exactly the same thing if I'd been in his place, and how most people didn't
appreciate how tough it is being a teacher. That kind of stuff. The old bull. The funny thing is, though, I was sort of thinking of something else while I shot
the bull. I live in New York, and I was thinking about the lagoon in Central Park, down
near Central Park South. I was wondering if it would be frozen over when I got home,
and if it was, where did the ducks go. I was wondering where the ducks went when the
lagoon got all icy and frozen over. I wondered if some guy came in a truck and took them
away to a zoo or something. Or if they just flew away. I'm lucky, though. I mean I could shoot the old bull to old Spencer and think
about those ducks at the same time. It's funny. You don't have to think too hard when you
talk to a teacher. All of a sudden, though, he interrupted me while I was shooting the bull. He was always interrupting you. "How do you feel about all this, boy? I'd be very interested to know. Very
interested."
 "You mean about my flunking out of Pencey and all?" I said. I sort of wished he'd
cover up his bumpy chest. It wasn't such a beautiful view. "If I'm not mistaken, I believe you also had some difficulty at the Whooton
School and at Elkton Hills." He didn't say it just sarcastic, but sort of nasty, too. "I didn't have too much difficulty at Elkton Hills," I told him. "I didn't exactly
flunk out or anything. I just quit, sort of."
 "Why, may I ask?"
 "Why? Oh, well it's a long story, sir. I mean it's pretty complicated." I didn't feel
like going into the whole thing with him. He wouldn't have understood it anyway. It
wasn't up his alley at all. One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was because I was
surrounded by phonies. That's all. They were coming in the goddam window. For
instance, they had this headmaster, Mr. Haas, that was the phoniest bastard I ever met in
my life. Ten times worse than old Thurmer. On Sundays, for instance, old Haas went
around shaking hands with everybody's parents when they drove up to school. He'd be
charming as hell and all. Except if some boy had little old funny-looking parents. You
should've seen the way he did with my roommate's parents. I mean if a boy's mother was
sort of fat or corny-looking or something, and if somebody's father was one of those guys
that wear those suits with very big shoulders and corny black-and-white shoes, then old
Hans would just shake hands with them and give them a phony smile and then he'd go
talk, for maybe a half an hour, with somebody else's parents. I can't stand that stuff. It
drives me crazy. It makes me so depressed I go crazy. I hated that goddam Elkton Hills. Old Spencer asked me something then, but I didn't hear him. I was thinking about
old Haas. "What, sir?" I said. "Do you have any particular qualms about leaving Pencey?"
 "Oh, I have a few qualms, all right. Sure. . . but not too many. Not yet, anyway. I
guess it hasn't really hit me yet. It takes things a while to hit me. All I'm doing right now
is thinking about going home Wednesday. I'm a moron."
 "Do you feel absolutely no concern for your future, boy?"
 "Oh, I feel some concern for my future, all right. Sure. Sure, I do." I thought about
it for a minute. "But not too much, I guess. Not too much, I guess."
 "You will," old Spencer said. "You will, boy. You will when it's too late."
 I didn't like hearing him say that. It made me sound dead or something. It was
very depressing. "I guess I will," I said. "I'd like to put some sense in that head of yours, boy. I'm trying to help you. I'm
trying to help you, if I can."
 He really was, too. You could see that. But it was just that we were too much on
opposite sides ot the pole, that's all. "I know you are, sir," I said. "Thanks a lot. No
kidding. I appreciate it. I really do." I got up from the bed then. Boy, I couldn't've sat
there another ten minutes to save my life. "The thing is, though, I have to get going now. I have quite a bit of equipment at the gym I have to get to take home with me. I really
do." He looked up at me and started nodding again, with this very serious look on his
face. I felt sorry as hell for him, all of a sudden. But I just couldn't hang around there any
longer, the way we were on opposite sides of the pole, and the way he kept missing the
bed whenever he chucked something at it, and his sad old bathrobe with his chest
showing, and that grippy smell of Vicks Nose Drops all over the place. "Look, sir. Don't
worry about me," I said. "I mean it. I'll be all right. I'm just going through a phase right
now. Everybody goes through phases and all, don't they?"
 "I don't know, boy. I don't know."
 I hate it when somebody answers that way.

Style and Tone Analysis:
Here are the guidelines for translating the provided English text segment:

### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration should capture the voice of a young, slightly jaded, yet fundamentally sincere and conversational teenager. It's an internal monologue delivered in an unpolished, stream-of-consciousness style. Avoid overly formal or literary Korean (문어체). Instead, lean heavily towards a colloquial, spoken language feel (구어체). The tone should be direct, at times cynical, at times humorous, and always personal. The frequent use of filler words and repetitions should be maintained to convey a natural, rambling thought process.
    *   **Recommended Korean Speech Level:** Predominantly **해라체** (Haera-che) for declarative sentences and descriptive passages, and **해체** (Hae-che) for internal thoughts and more personal, confessional remarks. This combination will best reflect the narrator's age, informality, and directness.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Internal Monologue:** The entire segment is Holden's subjective view. Maintain this first-person, highly personal perspective.
    *   **Hyperbole:** Phrases like "just about killed me," "damn near made you sick," "hated everybody's guts, damn near" are characteristic. Translate these exaggerations to convey the narrator's strong feelings and youthful dramatic flair.
    *   **Repetition/Filler Words:** Words and phrases like "and all," "or anything," "or something" are frequent. Find natural Korean equivalents (e.g., "~하고 그랬어," "~뭐랄까," "~뭐 그런 거") to preserve the conversational, slightly rambling quality without making it sound stiff or redundant.
    *   **Colloquialisms/Informal Language:** "knock me out," "lousy teeth," "guts," "not too crazy about him." Ensure these are translated with appropriate Korean colloquialisms that reflect a teenager's vocabulary, avoiding overly formal or archaic expressions.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden (화자)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Ackley
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Annoyed, dismissive, trying to end the interaction quickly, clearly uninterested in the conversation. He is focused on his book and wants to be left alone.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use a curt, unenthusiastic **해체** (Hae-che) or a blunt **해라체** (Haera-che). His replies are minimal, reflecting his desire to disengage.
        *   "Hi," I said, but I didn't look up from my book. → "안녕," 하고 나는 말했지만, 책에서 눈을 떼지 않았다. (해체)
        *   "Nobody won," I said. Without looking up, though. → "아무도 안 이겼어," 하고 나는 말했다. 그래도 고개를 들지 않고. (해체)
        *   "Nobody won," I said. → "아무도 안 이겼다고," 내가 말했다. (해체, 반복 시 강조)

*   **Character: Robert Ackley**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Bored, intrusive, seemingly casual but actually annoying and disruptive. He's not genuinely interested in the conversation but uses questions to bother Holden and invade his space. His "Hi" is explicitly described as "terrifically bored or terrifically tired."
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use a flat, unenthusiastic **해요체** (Haeyo-che) for general questions, or a slightly blunt **해체** (Hae-che) / **해라체** (Haera-che) for more direct or demanding inquiries. The aim is to convey his peculiar, lackadaisical yet intrusive personality.
        *   "Hi," he said. → "하이," 그가 말했다. (Can also be a very flat "안녕" or "어이" depending on the desired level of bluntness/disinterest)
        *   "How was the fencing?" he said. → "펜싱은 어땠냐?" 그가 말했다. (해체) or "펜싱 어땠어?" (해체)
        *   "We win, or what?" he said. → "우리 이겼냐, 아니면 뭐냐?" 그가 말했다. (해체) or "우리 이겼어, 아니면 뭐야?" (해체)
        *   "What?" he said. → "뭐?" 그가 말했다. (해체, blunt and demanding repetition)

### Immediate Context Used (English):
"Sure. Sure, they do," I said. "I mean
it, sir. Please don't worry about me." I sort of put my hand on his shoulder. "Okay?" I
said. "Wouldn't you like a cup of hot chocolate before you go? Mrs. Spencer would be-
-"
 "I would, I really would, but the thing is, I have to get going. I have to go right to
the gym. Thanks, though. Thanks a lot, sir."
 Then we shook hands. And all that crap. It made me feel sad as hell, though. "I'll drop you a line, sir. Take care of your grippe, now."
 "Good-by, boy."
 After I shut the door and started back to the living room, he yelled something at
me, but I couldn't exactly hear him. I'm pretty sure he yelled "Good luck!" at me,
 I hope to hell not. I'd never yell "Good luck!" at anybody. It sounds terrible, when
you think about it. 3
 I'm the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life. It's awful. If I'm on my way to
the store to buy a magazine, even, and somebody asks me where I'm going, I'm liable to
say I'm going to the opera. It's terrible. So when I told old Spencer I had to go to the gym
and get my equipment and stuff, that was a sheer lie. I don't even keep my goddam
equipment in the gym. Where I lived at Pencey, I lived in the Ossenburger Memorial Wing of the new
dorms. It was only for juniors and seniors. I was a junior. My roommate was a senior. It
was named after this guy Ossenburger that went to Pencey. He made a pot of dough in
the undertaking business after he got out of Pencey. What he did, he started these
undertaking parlors all over the country that you could get members of your family
buried for about five bucks apiece. You should see old Ossenburger. He probably just
shoves them in a sack and dumps them in the river. Anyway, he gave Pencey a pile of
dough, and they named our wing alter him. The first football game of the year, he came
up to school in this big goddam Cadillac, and we all had to stand up in the grandstand and
give him a locomotive--that's a cheer. Then, the next morning, in chapel, be made a
speech that lasted about ten hours. He started off with about fifty corny jokes, just to
show us what a regular guy he was. Very big deal. Then he started telling us how he was
never ashamed, when he was in some kind of trouble or something, to get right down his
knees and pray to God. He told us we should always pray to God--talk to Him and all--
wherever we were. He told us we ought to think of Jesus as our buddy and all. He said he
talked to Jesus all the time. Even when he was driving his car. That killed me. I just see
the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking Jesus to send him a few more
stiffs. The only good part of his speech was right in the middle of it. He was telling us all
about what a swell guy he was, what a hot-shot and all, then all of a sudden this guy
sitting in the row in front of me, Edgar Marsalla, laid this terrific fart. It was a very crude
thing to do, in chapel and all, but it was also quite amusing. Old Marsalla. He damn near
blew the roof off. Hardly anybody laughed out loud, and old Ossenburger made out like
he didn't even hear it, but old Thurmer, the headmaster, was sitting right next to him on
the rostrum and all, and you could tell he heard it. Boy, was he sore. He didn't say
anything then, but the next night he made us have compulsory study hall in the academic
building and he came up and made a speech. He said that the boy that had created the
disturbance in chapel wasn't fit to go to Pencey. We tried to get old Marsalla to rip off
another one, right while old Thurmer was making his speech, but be wasn't in the right
mood. Anyway, that's where I lived at Pencey. Old Ossenburger Memorial Wing, in the
new dorms. It was pretty nice to get back to my room, after I left old Spencer, because
everybody was down at the game, and the heat was on in our room, for a change. It felt
sort of cosy. I took off my coat and my tie and unbuttoned my shirt collar; and then I put
on this hat that I'd bought in New York that morning. It was this red hunting hat, with one
of those very, very long peaks. I saw it in the window of this sports store when we got out
of the subway, just after I noticed I'd lost all the goddam foils. It only cost me a buck. The way I wore it, I swung the old peak way around to the back--very corny, I'll admit,
but I liked it that way. I looked good in it that way. Then I got this book I was reading
and sat down in my chair. There were two chairs in every room. I had one and my
roommate, Ward Stradlater, had one. The arms were in sad shape, because everybody
was always sitting on them, but they were pretty comfortable chairs. The book I was reading was this book I took out of the library by mistake. They
gave me the wrong book, and I didn't notice it till I got back to my room. They gave me
Out of Africa, by Isak Dinesen. I thought it was going to stink, but it didn't. It was a very
good book. I'm quite illiterate, but I read a lot. My favorite author is my brother D.B., and
my next favorite is Ring Lardner. My brother gave me a book by Ring Lardner for my
birthday, just before I went to Pencey.

"그럼요. 그럼요, 다들 그러죠." 나는 말했다. "정말이에요, 선생님. 저 때문에 걱정하지 마세요." 나는 그의 어깨에 손을 얹는 시늉을 했다. "괜찮죠?" 나는 말했다. "가시기 전에 따뜻한 코코아 한 잔 하실래요? 스펜서 부인께서—"
"그러고 싶네, 정말 그러고 싶지만, 그게 말이지, 이제 가봐야 해. 바로 체육관으로 가야 하거든. 그래도 고맙네. 정말 고마워."
그리고 우리는 악수를 했다. 그 빌어먹을 시시한 짓을 다 하고 말이지. 그래도 빌어먹게 슬퍼졌다.
"연락드릴게요, 선생님. 독감 조심하시고요."
"잘 가거라, 꼬마야."
내가 문을 닫고 거실로 돌아가려는데 그가 나에게 뭔가를 소리쳤지만, 정확히 들리지는 않았다. 분명히 '행운을 빈다!'고 소리친 것 같았는데, 젠장, 아니었으면 좋겠다. 나는 누구에게도 '행운을 빈다!' 같은 소리는 절대 안 한다. 생각해 보면 정말 끔찍한 소리다.
3
나는 네가 평생 본 사람 중에 가장 엄청난 거짓말쟁이다. 끔찍하다. 잡지를 사러 가게에 가는 길이라도, 누가 나한테 어디 가냐고 물으면 오페라에 간다고 말할 수 있다. 정말이지 최악이다. 그러니까 스펜서 영감한테 체육관에 가서 장비 같은 걸 챙겨야 한다고 말한 건 순전히 거짓말이었다. 내 빌어먹을 장비는 체육관에 보관하지도 않는다.
내가 펜시에서 살던 곳은 신축 기숙사의 오센버거 기념관이었다. 거기는 3학년과 4학년만 쓸 수 있었다. 나는 3학년이었고, 내 룸메이트는 4학년이었다. 펜시 출신인 오센버거라는 사람의 이름을 딴 곳이었다. 그는 펜시를 졸업한 후 장의업으로 엄청난 돈을 벌었다. 그는 전국 각지에 장의사를 차려서 가족 한 명당 5달러 정도만 내면 장례를 치러줄 수 있게 했다. 오센버거 영감을 봤어야 하는데. 아마 시신을 자루에 밀어 넣어서 강에다 버렸을 거다. 어쨌든 그가 펜시에 거금을 기부했고, 그래서 우리 기숙사 동 이름을 그의 이름을 따서 지은 것이다. 그해 첫 미식축구 시합에 그는 빌어먹게 큰 캐딜락을 타고 학교에 왔다. 그리고 우리 모두는 관중석에 서서 그에게 기관차 환호성—그게 응원 구호였다—을 보내야 했다. 그러고는 다음 날 아침 예배당에서 거의 열 시간 동안 연설을 했다. 그는 자기가 얼마나 평범한 사람인지를 보여주겠다고 하면서 시시한 농담 쉰 개쯤으로 시작했다. 아주 대단한 일이지. 그리고는 어떤 곤경에 처하거나 할 때도 무릎 꿇고 하나님께 기도하는 것을 전혀 부끄러워하지 않았다고 말했다. 그는 우리가 어디에 있든 항상 하나님께 기도해야 한다고—그분과 대화하고 등등—말했다. 예수를 우리 친구처럼 생각해야 한다고도 했다. 그는 운전 중에도 항상 예수와 대화한다고 말했다. 그 말에 나는 기가 막혔다. 그 거대한 가짜 자식이 1단 기어를 넣으면서 예수에게 시신 몇 구만 더 보내달라고 하는 모습이 그냥 눈에 선했다. 그의 연설에서 유일하게 좋았던 부분은 딱 중간쯤이었다. 그가 자신이 얼마나 멋진 놈인지, 얼마나 대단한 인물인지 등등을 신나게 늘어놓고 있을 때였다, 갑자기 내 앞줄에 앉아 있던 에드거 마살라라는 놈이 엄청난 방귀를 뀌어댔다. 예배당에서 그런 짓을 하는 건 아주 무례한 짓이었지만, 한편으로는 꽤 재미있기도 했다. 마살라 영감. 거의 지붕을 날려버릴 뻔했다. 큰 소리로 웃는 사람은 거의 없었고, 오센버거 영감은 못 들은 척했지만, 바로 옆 연단에 앉아 있던 교장 써머 영감은 분명히 들었다는 걸 알 수 있었다. 젠장, 그가 얼마나 화가 났던지. 그때는 아무 말도 안 했지만, 다음 날 밤 그는 우리에게 학과 건물에서 의무 자율 학습을 시키고는 와서 연설을 했다. 그는 예배당에서 소란을 피운 그 놈은 펜시에 다닐 자격이 없다고 말했다. 써머 영감이 연설하는 내내 마살라 영감에게 또 한 방 터뜨리라고 부추겼지만, 그 놈은 그럴 기분이 아니었다. 아무튼, 그게 내가 펜시에서 살던 곳이었다. 신축 기숙사의 오센버거 기념관 말이다. 스펜서 영감을 떠나 내 방으로 돌아오니 꽤 좋았다. 다들 시합 구경을 가고 없었고, 오랜만에 우리 방에 난방도 들어와 있었다. 왠지 아늑하게 느껴졌다. 코트와 넥타이를 벗고 셔츠 칼라 단추를 풀었다. 그리고 그날 아침 뉴욕에서 산 모자를 썼다. 그건 아주 아주 긴 챙이 달린 빨간 사냥 모자였다. 지하철에서 내린 직후 빌어먹을 검들을 다 잃어버렸다는 걸 알아차린 뒤, 스포츠 용품점 진열창에서 그걸 봤다. 겨우 1달러밖에 안 했다. 나는 그 모자를 챙이 뒤로 가도록 돌려 썼다—솔직히 말해 아주 촌스럽지만, 나는 그게 좋았다. 그렇게 쓰니 잘 어울렸다. 그러고는 읽던 책을 가져와 의자에 앉았다. 방마다 의자가 두 개씩 있었다. 나 하나, 룸메이트인 워드 스트라드레이터가 하나. 팔걸이는 사람들이 늘 그 위에 앉아 있어서 엉망이었지만, 꽤 편안한 의자들이었다.
내가 읽던 책은 도서관에서 실수로 빌려온 책이었다. 직원들이 잘못 준 책인데, 방에 돌아와서야 알아차렸다. 이사크 디네센의 『아웃 오브 아프리카』를 준 것이다. 시시할 거라고 생각했는데, 아니었다. 아주 좋은 책이었다. 나는 글을 잘 모르는 편인데도 책은 많이 읽는다. 내가 가장 좋아하는 작가는 형 D.B.이고, 그다음은 링 라드너다. 형이 펜시에 가기 직전 내 생일 선물로 링 라드너의 책을 한 권 줬다.

Style and Tone Analysis:
Here are the practical and actionable guidelines for translating the provided English text segment, focusing on maintaining consistent and context-aware tone and speaking style in Korean.

---

### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is highly informal, colloquial, and conversational, reflecting the unfiltered internal monologue of a cynical, observant, and often sarcastic teenage boy (Holden). It should feel as if Holden is directly addressing the reader in a stream-of-consciousness manner. The language should be raw, direct, and youthful, often bordering on bluntness or casual indifference, yet capable of expressing deep annoyance or playful "horsing around."
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **First-person perspective & Internal Monologue:** Maintain a strong sense of Holden's immediate thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. The narration should feel like his unfiltered voice.
    *   **Sarcasm & Irony:** Crucial to Holden's character. Translate the underlying sardonic wit and dry humor rather than just the literal meaning.
    *   **Colloquialisms & Slang:** Find natural Korean equivalents that convey the same level of informality, youthfulness, and period-appropriate casualness without sounding dated or overly formal. Examples include "goddam," "hell," "horsing around," "gives me a bang," "for Chrissake."
    *   **Repetition:** Holden frequently repeats phrases or ideas for emphasis or to reflect his obsessive/annoyed thoughts (e.g., "He was always cleaning his fingernails."). Preserve this characteristic where it feels natural and contributes to his voice.
    *   **Exaggeration:** Holden often exaggerates ("hurt like hell," "damn near killed old Ackley"). Convey this over-the-top, teenage dramatic flair.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** For the narration, primarily use an informal **해체 (Hae-che)** or **해라체 (Haera-che)**. This choice best reflects Holden's unfiltered, conversational, and direct internal monologue. Avoid any formal speech levels (해요체, 하십시오체, 하오체).

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden**
    *   **Speaking to:** Ackley
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Holden's dialogue with Ackley is characterized by a mix of sarcasm, playful annoyance, bluntness, and occasional exasperation. He often uses humor (dark or light) as a defense mechanism or a way to needle Ackley.
        *   "This sentence I'm reading is terrific." (Sarcastic, dismissive, slightly superior)
        *   "I think I'm going blind... Mother darling, everything's getting so dark in here." / "Mother darling, give me your hand, Why won't you give me your hand?" (Playful, mocking, deliberately irritating Ackley, "horsing around")
        *   "Like hell it is." (Defensive, dismissive, asserting his own opinion forcefully)
        *   "This is a people shooting hat... I shoot people in this hat." (Sarcastic, provocative, dark humor)
        *   "Nope." / "Down at the game. He's got a date." (Blunt, brief, slightly annoyed or bored with the questioning)
        *   "No. I packed them already. They're way in the top of the closet." (Direct, slightly exasperated, hinting at inconvenience but ultimately complying)
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Consistently use **해라체 (Haera-che)** or informal **해체 (Hae-che)** for all dialogue with Ackley. This reflects their close but often antagonistic roommate relationship. The tone should shift according to context, from sarcastic and mocking to blunt and slightly annoyed. Avoid any politeness markers (e.g., -요 endings).

*   **Character: Ackley**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Ackley's dialogue is generally blunt, direct, often intrusive, and lacks much social finesse. He can be demanding, opinionated, and easily exasperated by Holden's antics. He shows a simple curiosity but often in an tactless manner.
        *   "What the hellya reading?" / "Any good?" (Intrusive, direct, simple curiosity)
        *   "You're nuts. I swear to God," / "For Chrissake, grow up." (Annoyed, exasperated, dismissive of Holden's antics)
        *   "Who belongsa this?" (Curious, slightly ungrammatical/awkward phrasing, reflecting his character)
        *   "Where the hellja get that hat?" / "How much?" (Direct, simple curiosity, perhaps a bit nosy)
        *   "You got robbed." (Opinionated, slightly condescending, trying to sound knowledgeable)
        *   "Up home we wear a hat like that to shoot deer in, for Chrissake... That's a deer shooting hat." (Asserting his own experience/knowledge, slightly dismissive of Holden's hat style)
        *   "Your folks know you got kicked out yet?" (Intrusive, blunt, potentially provocative, showing lack of tact)
        *   "Where the hell's Stradlater at, anyway?" (Direct, simple curiosity)
        *   "The great Stradlater," (Slightly sarcastic, perhaps a bit envious or dismissive of Stradlater)
        *   "Hey. Lend me your scissors a second, willya? Ya got 'em handy?" / "Get 'em a second, willya?" (Demanding, persistent, expecting immediate compliance without much consideration for Holden's convenience)
        *   "I got this hangnail I want to cut off." (Providing a reason, but still in a demanding tone)
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Like Holden, Ackley should primarily use **해라체 (Haera-che)** or informal **해체 (Hae-che)** when speaking to Holden. His tone should be generally blunt, sometimes demanding or opinionated, and often exasperated. His lack of social grace and slight awkwardness should be subtly conveyed through his phrasing and directness.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
It had these very funny, crazy plays in it, and then
it had this one story about a traffic cop that falls in love with this very cute girl that's
always speeding. Only, he's married, the cop, so be can't marry her or anything. Then this
girl gets killed, because she's always speeding. That story just about killed me. What I
like best is a book that's at least funny once in a while. I read a lot of classical books, like
The Return of the Native and all, and I like them, and I read a lot of war books and
mysteries and all, but they don't knock me out too much. What really knocks me out is a
book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific
friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That
doesn't happen much, though. I wouldn't mind calling this Isak Dinesen up. And Ring
Lardner, except that D.B. told me he's dead. You take that book Of Human Bondage, by
Somerset Maugham, though. I read it last summer. It's a pretty good book and all, but I
wouldn't want to call Somerset Maugham up. I don't know, He just isn't the kind of guy
I'd want to call up, that's all. I'd rather call old Thomas Hardy up. I like that Eustacia Vye. Anyway, I put on my new hat and sat down and started reading that book Out of
Africa. I'd read it already, but I wanted to read certain parts over again. I'd only read
about three pages, though, when I heard somebody coming through the shower curtains. Even without looking up, I knew right away who it was. It was Robert Ackley, this guy
that roomed right next to me. There was a shower right between every two rooms in our
wing, and about eighty-five times a day old Ackley barged in on me. He was probably the
only guy in the whole dorm, besides me, that wasn't down at the game. He hardly ever
went anywhere. He was a very peculiar guy. He was a senior, and he'd been at Pencey the
whole four years and all, but nobody ever called him anything except "Ackley." Not even
Herb Gale, his own roommate, ever called him "Bob" or even "Ack." If he ever gets
married, his own wife'll probably call him "Ackley." He was one of these very, very tall,
round-shouldered guys--he was about six four--with lousy teeth. The whole time he
roomed next to me, I never even once saw him brush his teeth. They always looked
mossy and awful, and he damn near made you sick if you saw him in the dining room
with his mouth full of mashed potatoes and peas or something. Besides that, he had a lot
of pimples. Not just on his forehead or his chin, like most guys, but all over his whole
face. And not only that, he had a terrible personality. He was also sort of a nasty guy. I
wasn't too crazy about him, to tell you the truth. I could feel him standing on the shower ledge, right behind my chair, taking a
look to see if Stradlater was around. He hated Stradlater's guts and he never came in the
room if Stradlater was around. He hated everybody's guts, damn near. He came down off the shower ledge and came in the room. "Hi," he said. He
always said it like he was terrifically bored or terrifically tired. He didn't want you to
think he was visiting you or anything. He wanted you to think he'd come in by mistake,
for God's sake. "Hi," I said, but I didn't look up from my book. With a guy like Ackley, if you
looked up from your book you were a goner. You were a goner anyway, but not as quick
if you didn't look up right away. He started walking around the room, very slow and all, the way he always did,
picking up your personal stuff off your desk and chiffonier. He always picked up your
personal stuff and looked at it. Boy, could he get on your nerves sometimes. "How was
the fencing?" he said. He just wanted me to quit reading and enjoying myself. He didn't
give a damn about the fencing. "We win, or what?" he said. "Nobody won," I said. Without looking up, though. "What?" he said. He always made you say everything twice. "Nobody won," I said. I sneaked a look to see what he was fiddling around with
on my chiffonier. He was looking at this picture of this girl I used to go around with in
New York, Sally Hayes. He must've picked up that goddam picture and looked at it at
least five thousand times since I got it. He always put it back in the wrong place, too,
when he was finished. He did it on purpose. You could tell. "Nobody won," he said. "How come?"
 "I left the goddam foils and stuff on the subway." I still didn't look up at him. "On the subway, for Chrissake! Ya lost them, ya mean?"
 "We got on the wrong subway. I had to keep getting up to look at a goddam map
on the wall."
 He came over and stood right in my light. "Hey," I said. "I've read this same
sentence about twenty times since you came in."
 Anybody else except Ackley would've taken the goddam hint. Not him, though. "Think they'll make ya pay for em?" he said. "I don't know, and I don't give a damn. How 'bout sitting down or something,
Ackley kid? You're right in my goddam light." He didn't like it when you called him
"Ackley kid." He was always telling me I was a goddam kid, because I was sixteen and
he was eighteen.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** 비격식적이고 구어체적인(colloquial) 문체로, 주인공 홀든의 시니컬하면서도 솔직한 내면의 목소리를 담아내야 합니다. 마치 독자에게 직접 이야기하듯 친구에게 말하는 듯한 편안하고 건조한 어조(dry and observational tone)를 유지합니다. 문어체보다는 구어체에 가깝게 번역하며, 문장 호흡은 자연스럽게 이어지도록 합니다. 홀든의 독특한 개성과 시점을 일관되게 유지하는 것이 중요합니다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:** 홀든의 '의식의 흐름(stream of consciousness)'과 '내면 독백(internal monologue)'을 살려 번역합니다. 그의 독특한 구어적 표현과 비속어(예: "sonuvabitch", "goddam", "crumby"), 반복되는 강조 표현을 원문의 뉘앙스를 살려 한국어 비속어나 일상적인 강조 표현으로 자연스럽게 녹여냅니다. 아이러니와 냉소적인 시각을 유지하는 것이 중요하며, 홀든의 서술에서 드러나는 인물에 대한 관찰과 평가를 명확히 드러냅니다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: "I" (Holden)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Ackley
    *   **Context/Emotion:**
        *   (네일 깎는 상황) 짜증과 불만, 직접적인 경고와 반복되는 지시. 애클리의 행동에 대한 극도의 피로감.
        *   (스트라드레이터 변호 상황) 애클리에게 상황을 설명하고 설득하려 노력하지만, 답답함을 느끼는 상태. 직접적인 어조지만 일방적으로 몰아붙이기보다 이해시키려 하는 의도도 엿보임.
        *   (애클리와의 논쟁) 애클리의 주장에 대한 반박, 그의 신경을 긁는 듯한 장난기 섞인 도발 ("Ackley kid"), 그러나 전체적으로는 솔직하고 직설적인 친구 간의 대화.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   기본적으로 **해체(hae-che)** 또는 **해라체(haera-che)**를 사용하여 친구 간의 편하고 직설적인 대화를 표현합니다.
        *   네일 깎는 상황에서는 짜증과 지시를 담아 **해라체**에 가깝게 ("야, 테이블 위에서 손톱 깎지 마.", "야, 애클리! 제발 좀!"). 반복적인 질책의 뉘앙스를 살립니다.
        *   스트라드레이터를 변호할 때는 설득하려는 의도를 담아 **해체**를 사용하되, 너무 부드럽지 않게 홀든의 원래 말투를 유지합니다. ("기분 나쁘게 하려던 게 아니었어", "네가 그를 잘 몰라서 그래").
        *   "Ackley kid"와 같은 표현은 애클리를 살짝 놀리는 듯하거나, 때로는 무시하는 듯한 느낌을 살려 번역하고, "No, you're not" 같은 반박은 **해체**로 단호하게 표현합니다. 전반적으로 반말을 사용하며 홀든의 시니컬하고 직설적인 성격을 드러냅니다.

*   **Character: "I" (Holden)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Stradlater
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 스트라드레이터의 급작스러운 등장과 요청에 대한 반응. 기본적으로는 짜증이 섞여 있지만, 친구로서의 일상적인 대화.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 스트라드레이터와는 동갑 친구이므로, **해체(hae-che)**를 사용하여 편하고 격의 없는 대화를 표현합니다. "뭐야, 눈 오냐?"나 "누가 이겼어?" 등 구어적인 표현을 살려 번역합니다. 자켓을 빌려주기 싫은 마음을 표현할 때도 **해체**로 단호하게 말합니다. (예: "아니, 근데 네 어깨 때문에 늘어나는 건 싫어.")

*   **Character: Ackley**
    *   **Speaking to:** "I" (Holden)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 스트라드레이터에 대한 깊은 불만과 분노, 짜증이 가득한 상태. 자신의 위생에 대한 지적에는 방어적이고 공격적인 반응을 보이며, 홀든의 도발에는 극도로 불쾌해 합니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   분노와 짜증, 비속어를 섞어 매우 거칠고 공격적인 **해라체(haera-che)** 또는 **해체(hae-che)**를 사용합니다. "sonuvabitch," "goddam"과 같은 비속어는 한국어에서도 상응하는 강한 비속어(예: "개자식", "젠장할")로 번역하여 애클리의 감정을 생생하게 전달합니다.
        *   "Don't gimme that," "Stop calling me 'Ackley kid,' God damn it. I'm old enough to be your lousy father." 와 같은 표현은 상대를 향한 불쾌감과 반항심을 최대한 살려 거친 **해라체**나 **해체**로 번역하며, 때로는 명령조의 어미를 사용하여 공격적인 태도를 부각합니다.
        *   스트라드레이터가 "How'sa boy?"라고 했을 때의 "grunt"는 대꾸하기 싫어하는 비협조적인 태도를 나타내므로, 대사 없이 "콧방귀를 뀌었다" 또는 "흥 하고 코웃음을 쳤다" 등으로 처리하여 묵묵부답에 가까운 거부감을 표현합니다.

*   **Character: Stradlater**
    *   **Speaking to:** "I" (Holden), Ackley
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 항상 바쁘고 여유 없어 보이지만, 기본적으로는 자신감 있고 태평하며, 홀든에게는 친근한 (다소 자기중심적인) 태도를 보입니다. 애클리에게는 형식적이고 무심한 인사.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   홀든에게는 **해체(hae-che)**를 사용하여 친근하고 격의 없는 친구 사이의 대화를 표현합니다. 다만, 자신의 요구를 관철시키려는 듯한 미묘한 압력이나 자만심이 느껴지는 어조를 살려 번역합니다. ("들어봐," "특별히 나가는 데 없어? 그럼 자켓 좀 빌려줄 수 있어?"). 급한 성격을 반영하여 대사가 빠르게 이어지는 느낌을 줍니다.
        *   애클리에게는 "How'sa boy, Ackley?"는 형식적이고 다소 무심한 인사로, **해체**를 사용하되 친근함보다는 의례적인 느낌을 살려 번역합니다. ("애클리, 잘 있었냐?").

### Immediate Context Used (English):
It drove him mad when I called him "Ackley kid."
 He kept standing there. He was exactly the kind of a guy that wouldn't get out of
your light when you asked him to. He'd do it, finally, but it took him a lot longer if you
asked him to. "What the hellya reading?" he said. "Goddam book."
 He shoved my book back with his hand so that he could see the name of it. "Any
good?" he said. "This sentence I'm reading is terrific." I can be quite sarcastic when I'm in the
mood. He didn't get It, though. He started walking around the room again, picking up all
my personal stuff, and Stradlater's. Finally, I put my book down on the floor. You
couldn't read anything with a guy like Ackley around. It was impossible. I slid way the hell down in my chair and watched old Ackley making himself at
home. I was feeling sort of tired from the trip to New York and all, and I started yawning. Then I started horsing around a little bit. Sometimes I horse around quite a lot, just to
keep from getting bored. What I did was, I pulled the old peak of my hunting hat around
to the front, then pulled it way down over my eyes. That way, I couldn't see a goddam
thing. "I think I'm going blind," I said in this very hoarse voice. "Mother darling,
everything's getting so dark in here."
 "You're nuts. I swear to God," Ackley said. "Mother darling, give me your hand, Why won't you give me your hand?"
 "For Chrissake, grow up."
 I started groping around in front of me, like a blind guy, but without getting up or
anything. I kept saying, "Mother darling, why won't you give me your hand?" I was only
horsing around, naturally. That stuff gives me a bang sometimes. Besides, I know it
annoyed hell out of old Ackley. He always brought out the old sadist in me. I was pretty
sadistic with him quite often. Finally, I quit, though. I pulled the peak around to the back
again, and relaxed. "Who belongsa this?" Ackley said. He was holding my roommate's knee
supporter up to show me. That guy Ackley'd pick up anything. He'd even pick up your
jock strap or something. I told him it was Stradlater's. So he chucked it on Stradlater's
bed. He got it off Stradlater's chiffonier, so he chucked it on the bed. He came over and sat down on the arm of Stradlater's chair. He never sat down in
a chair. Just always on the arm. "Where the hellja get that hat?" he said. "New York."
 "How much?"
 "A buck."
 "You got robbed." He started cleaning his goddam fingernails with the end of a
match. He was always cleaning his fingernails. It was funny, in a way. His teeth were
always mossy-looking, and his ears were always dirty as hell, but he was always cleaning
his fingernails. I guess he thought that made him a very neat guy. He took another look at
my hat while he was cleaning them. "Up home we wear a hat like that to shoot deer in,
for Chrissake," he said. "That's a deer shooting hat."
 "Like hell it is." I took it off and looked at it. I sort of closed one eye, like I was
taking aim at it. "This is a people shooting hat," I said. "I shoot people in this hat."
 "Your folks know you got kicked out yet?"
 "Nope."
 "Where the hell's Stradlater at, anyway?"
 "Down at the game. He's got a date." I yawned. I was yawning all over the place. For one thing, the room was too damn hot. It made you sleepy. At Pencey, you either
froze to death or died of the heat. "The great Stradlater," Ackley said. "--Hey. Lend me your scissors a second,
willya? Ya got 'em handy?"
 "No. I packed them already. They're way in the top of the closet."
 "Get 'em a second, willya?" Ackley said, "I got this hangnail I want to cut off."
 He didn't care if you'd packed something or not and had it way in the top of the
closet. I got them for him though. I nearly got killed doing it, too. The second I opened
the closet door, Stradlater's tennis racket--in its wooden press and all--fell right on my
head. It made a big clunk, and it hurt like hell. It damn near killed old Ackley, though. He
started laughing in this very high falsetto voice. He kept laughing the whole time I was
taking down my suitcase and getting the scissors out for him. Something like that--a guy
getting hit on the head with a rock or something--tickled the pants off Ackley. "You have
a damn good sense of humor, Ackley kid," I told him. "You know that?" I handed him the
scissors. "Lemme be your manager. I'll get you on the goddam radio." I sat down in my
chair again, and he started cutting his big horny-looking nails. "How 'bout using the table
or something?" I said. "Cut 'em over the table, willya? I don't feel like walking on your
crumby nails in my bare feet tonight." He kept right on cutting them over the floor,
though. What lousy manners. I mean it. "Who's Stradlater's date?" he said. He was always keeping tabs on who Stradlater
was dating, even though he hated Stradlater's guts. "I don't know. Why?"
 "No reason. Boy, I can't stand that sonuvabitch. He's one sonuvabitch I really can't
stand."
 "He's crazy about you. He told me he thinks you're a goddam prince," I said. I call
people a "prince" quite often when I'm horsing around. It keeps me from getting bored or
something.

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is informal, highly conversational, and stream-of-consciousness (의식의 흐름). It should feel like a direct monologue from a disaffected, cynical, and observant teenager. The tone is largely personal, often critical, and leans heavily towards a spoken-like style (구어체) rather than a formal literary style (문어체). Preserve Holden's distinctive voice: his tendency to ramble, his frequent asides, and his blunt, sometimes crude, observations.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Internal Monologue:** A significant portion of the text is Holden's unfiltered thoughts, opinions, and reactions. This should be rendered directly and informally.
    *   **Colloquialism & Slang:** The text is rife with informal language, expletives ("goddam," "hell"), and slang ("hot-shot," "up the creek," "royal pain in the ass"). These must be translated with equivalent Korean informal expressions and slang that fit a teenager's vocabulary, avoiding overly formal or archaic terms.
    *   **Hyperbole:** Holden frequently uses exaggeration (e.g., "rusty as hell," "madly in love with himself"). Maintain this sense of youthful overstatement.
    *   **Irony:** Holden explicitly points out irony ("It was very ironical. It really was."). Ensure this self-aware irony is conveyed.
    *   **Repetition:** The repetition of certain words or phrases (e.g., "secret slob," "goddam") should be preserved to emphasize Holden's fixations or exasperation.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden (Narrator/Speaker)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Stradlater
    *   **Context/Emotion:**
        *   "What?": Initial response is unenthusiastic and slightly dismissive.
        *   "I'm the one that's flunking out of the goddam place, and you're asking me to write you a goddam composition": Exasperated, cynical, pointing out the absurdity and unfairness of the situation.
        *   "What on?": Still unenthusiastic, direct, and slightly resigned.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use an informal and blunt **해라체 (Haera-che)**. His responses should reflect his world-weary, slightly rebellious nature and lack of enthusiasm for Stradlater's requests. Use vocabulary that conveys his cynical observations and inner thoughts, even in dialogue.

*   **Character: Stradlater**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden
    *   **Context/Emotion:**
        *   "Hey," "Wanna do me a big favor?": Casual, presumptuous, slightly manipulative, setting up a request.
        *   "You goin' out tonight?": Direct, leading question.
        *   "I got about a hundred pages to read for history for Monday," "How 'bout writing a composition for me, for English? I'll be up the creek if I don't get the goddam thing in by Monday, the reason I ask. How 'bout it?": Whining, entitled, attempting to offload responsibility, using a mix of desperation and casual expectation.
        *   "Yeah, I know. The thing is, though, I'll be up the creek if I don't get it in. Be a buddy. Be a buddyroo. Okay?": More pleading, trying to appeal to their friendship, still self-serving.
        *   "Anything. Anything descriptive. A room. Or a house. Or something you once lived in or something-- you know. Just as long as it's descriptive as hell.": Lazy, vague, indifferent to the quality of the task, reinforcing his "slob" nature.
        *   "Just don't do it too good, is all," "That sonuvabitch Hartzell thinks you're a hot-shot in English, and he knows you're my roommate. So I mean don't stick all the commas and stuff in the right place.": Condescending, manipulative, revealing his insecurity and desire to manage others' perceptions for his own benefit.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use an informal **해라체 (Haera-che)**, as they are close peers. However, the choice of vocabulary and sentence endings within **해라체** should convey Stradlater's specific character traits: his arrogance, self-absorption, entitlement, and occasional whininess or manipulation. For instance, his requests should sound presumptuous despite the "favor" framing, and his final comments should have a subtly condescending or patronizing nuance.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
"He's got this superior attitude all the time," Ackley said. "I just can't stand the
sonuvabitch. You'd think he--"
 "Do you mind cutting your nails over the table, hey?" I said. "I've asked you about
fifty--"
 "He's got this goddam superior attitude all the time," Ackley said. "I don't even
think the sonuvabitch is intelligent. He thinks he is. He thinks he's about the most--"
 "Ackley! For Chrissake. Willya please cut your crumby nails over the table? I've
asked you fifty times."
 He started cutting his nails over the table, for a change. The only way he ever did
anything was if you yelled at him. I watched him for a while. Then I said, "The reason you're sore at Stradlater is
because he said that stuff about brushing your teeth once in a while. He didn't mean to
insult you, for cryin' out loud. He didn't say it right or anything, but he didn't mean
anything insulting. All he meant was you'd look better and feel better if you sort of
brushed your teeth once in a while."
 "I brush my teeth. Don't gimme that."
 "No, you don't. I've seen you, and you don't," I said. I didn't say it nasty, though. I
felt sort of sorry for him, in a way. I mean it isn't too nice, naturally, if somebody tells
you you don't brush your teeth. "Stradlater's all right He's not too bad," I said. "You don't
know him, thats the trouble."
 "I still say he's a sonuvabitch. He's a conceited sonuvabitch."
 "He's conceited, but he's very generous in some things. He really is," I said. "Look. Suppose, for instance, Stradlater was wearing a tie or something that you liked. Say he had a tie on that you liked a helluva lot--I'm just giving you an example, now. You know what he'd do? He'd probably take it off and give it ta you. He really would. Or--you know what he'd do? He'd leave it on your bed or something. But he'd give you
the goddam tie. Most guys would probably just--"
 "Hell," Ackley said. "If I had his dough, I would, too."
 "No, you wouldn't." I shook my head. "No, you wouldn't, Ackley kid. If you had
his dough, you'd be one of the biggest--"
 "Stop calling me 'Ackley kid,' God damn it. I'm old enough to be your lousy
father."
 "No, you're not." Boy, he could really be aggravating sometimes. He never missed
a chance to let you know you were sixteen and he was eighteen. "In the first place, I
wouldn't let you in my goddam family," I said. "Well, just cut out calling me--"
 All of a sudden the door opened, and old Stradlater barged in, in a big hurry. He
was always in a big hurry. Everything was a very big deal. He came over to me and gave
me these two playful as hell slaps on both cheeks--which is something that can be very
annoying. 'Listen," he said. "You going out anywheres special tonight?"
 "I don't know. I might. What the hell's it doing out--snowing?" He had snow all
over his coat. "Yeah. Listen. If you're not going out anyplace special, how 'bout lending me
your hound's-tooth jacket?"
 "Who won the game?" I said. "It's only the half. We're leaving," Stradlater said. "No kidding, you gonna use
your hound's-tooth tonight or not? I spilled some crap all over my gray flannel."
 "No, but I don't want you stretching it with your goddam shoulders and all," I
said. We were practically the same heighth, but he weighed about twice as much as I did. He had these very broad shoulders. "I won't stretch it." He went over to the closet in a big hurry. "How'sa boy,
Ackley?" he said to Ackley. He was at least a pretty friendly guy, Stradlater. It was partly
a phony kind of friendly, but at least he always said hello to Ackley and all. Ackley just sort of grunted when he said "How'sa boy?" He wouldn't answer him,
but he didn't have guts enough not to at least grunt. Then he said to me, "I think I'll get
going. See ya later."
 "Okay," I said. He never exactly broke your heart when he went back to his own
room. Old Stradlater started taking off his coat and tie and all. "I think maybe I'll take a
fast shave," he said. He had a pretty heavy beard. He really did. "Where's your date?" I asked him. "She's waiting in the Annex." He went out of the room with his toilet kit and
towel under his arm. No shirt on or anything. He always walked around in his bare torso
because he thought he had a damn good build. He did, too. I have to admit it. 4
 I didn't have anything special to do, so I went down to the can and chewed the rag
with him while he was shaving. We were the only ones in the can, because everybody
was still down at the game. It was hot as hell and the windows were all steamy. There
were about ten washbowls, all right against the wall. Stradlater had the middle one. I sat
down on the one right next to him and started turning the cold water on and off--this
nervous habit I have. Stradlater kept whistling 'Song of India" while he shaved. He had
one of those very piercing whistles that are practically never in tune, and he always
picked out some song that's hard to whistle even if you're a good whistler, like "Song of
India" or "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue." He could really mess a song up. You remember I said before that Ackley was a slob in his personal habits?

“그 자식은 맨날 잘난 척이야.” 애클리가 말했다. “그 개자식은 정말 못 봐주겠어. 꼭 자기 혼자만—”
“야, 테이블 위에서 손톱 좀 깎지 그래? 내가 한 오십 번은—” 내가 말했다.
“그 개자식은 빌어먹을 잘난 척을 맨날 해.” 애클리가 말했다. “그 개자식은 똑똑하지도 않은 것 같아. 자긴 똑똑하다고 생각하겠지만 말이야. 자기가 세상에서 제일—”
“애클리! 제발 좀! 너 빌어먹을 그 더러운 손톱 좀 테이블 위에서 깎아줄래? 오십 번은 말했어.”
그제야 그는 테이블 위에서 손톱을 깎기 시작했다. 소리를 질러야만 겨우 움직이는 녀석이었다. 나는 한동안 그를 지켜보다가 말했다. “네가 스트래드레이터한테 화난 건 그 녀석이 이따금 양치질 좀 하라고 해서 그런 거잖아. 젠장, 널 모욕하려던 게 아니었다고. 제대로 말한 건 아니지만, 모욕적인 뜻은 없었어. 그저 네가 이따금 양치질을 하면 더 보기 좋고 기분도 나을 거라고 말하고 싶었던 것뿐이야.”
“나 양치질 해. 말도 안 되는 소리 하지 마.”
“아니, 안 해. 내가 봤는데, 너 안 해.” 나는 말했다. 하지만 불쾌하게 말한 건 아니었다. 어쩐지 그가 불쌍하게 느껴졌다. 누가 양치질을 안 한다고 대놓고 말하면 기분 좋을 리 없으니까 말이다. “스트래드레이터 괜찮아. 그렇게 나쁜 녀석 아니야.” 내가 말했다. “네가 그를 몰라서 그래, 그게 문제야.”
“그래도 그 자식은 개자식이야. 거만한 개자식이라고.”
“그 자식 거만하긴 해도, 어떤 면에서는 진짜 관대하다고. 정말 그래.” 내가 말했다. “봐봐. 예를 들어, 스트래드레이터가 네가 좋아하는 넥타이나 그런 걸 하고 있다고 쳐봐. 네가 진짜 엄청 마음에 드는 넥타이를 하고 있다고 해봐—그냥 예를 드는 거야, 지금. 그 녀석이 어떻게 할 줄 알아? 아마 풀어서 너한테 줄 거야. 진짜 그럴걸. 아니면—어떻게 할 줄 알아? 네 침대 같은 데에 두고 갈 거야. 어쨌든 그 빌어먹을 넥타이를 너한테 줄 거라고. 대부분의 녀석들은 그냥—”
“젠장.” 애클리가 말했다. “나도 그 자식 돈 있으면 그렇게 하겠다.”
“아니, 넌 안 그럴걸.” 나는 고개를 저었다. “아니, 넌 안 그럴 거야, 애클리. 네가 그 자식 돈이 있었다면, 넌 가장 큰—”
“나더러 ‘애클리’라고 부르지 마, 젠장할. 내가 네 빌어먹을 아빠뻘은 된다고.”
“아니, 아니야.” 젠장, 그 녀석은 가끔 정말 사람을 짜증 나게 할 때가 있었다. 그는 내가 열여섯이고 자기가 열여덟이라는 걸 알려줄 기회를 절대 놓치지 않았다. “우선, 난 널 내 빌어먹을 가족에 절대 들이지 않을 거야.” 내가 말했다. “자, 나더러 그만 좀 불러—”
갑자기 문이 열리며 스트래드레이터가 잔뜩 서둘러 불쑥 들어왔다. 그는 늘 그렇게 바빴다. 모든 일이 다 대단한 일이었다. 그는 내게 다가와 양쪽 뺨에 빌어먹게 장난스러운 손바닥을 두 번 철썩 때렸다—그건 정말 짜증 나는 짓이었다. “들어봐.” 그가 말했다. “오늘 밤 특별히 나가는 데 없어?”
“모르겠어. 나갈 수도 있고. 뭐야, 밖에—눈 오냐?” 그의 코트에는 온통 눈이 붙어 있었다. “응. 들어봐. 특별히 나가는 데 없으면, 네 체크무늬 재킷 좀 빌려줄 수 있어?”
“누가 이겼는데?” 내가 말했다. “이제 겨우 전반전이야. 우린 나가.” 스트래드레이터가 말했다. “농담 말고, 오늘 밤에 네 체크무늬 재킷 입을 거야 말 거야? 내 회색 플란넬에 뭐 좀 흘렸거든.”
“아니, 근데 네 빌어먹을 어깨 때문에 늘어나는 건 싫어.” 내가 말했다. 우리는 키는 거의 같았지만, 그 녀석은 나보다 두 배는 나갔다. 어깨가 엄청나게 넓었다. “안 늘릴게.” 그는 잔뜩 서둘러 옷장으로 갔다. “애클리, 잘 있었냐?” 그가 애클리에게 말했다. 스트래드레이터는 적어도 꽤 친절한 녀석이었다. 부분적으로는 가짜 친절이었지만, 적어도 애클리에게는 항상 인사 정도는 했다. 애클리는 그가 “잘 있었냐?”라고 했을 때 그저 콧방귀를 뀌는 시늉만 했다. 대답은 하지 않았지만, 적어도 콧방귀라도 뀌지 않을 만큼 배짱이 없었다. 그러고는 내게 말했다. “나 이만 가봐야겠다. 나중에 보자.”
“알았어.” 내가 말했다. 그 녀석이 자기 방으로 돌아갈 때면 딱히 아쉽지도 않았다. 스트래드레이터는 코트와 넥타이 등을 벗기 시작했다. “면도나 후딱 해야겠다.” 그가 말했다. 그 녀석은 턱수염이 꽤 덥수룩했다. 정말 그랬다. “네 데이트 상대는?” 내가 그에게 물었다. “별관에서 기다려.” 그는 세면도구와 수건을 팔에 끼고 방을 나섰다. 셔츠도 입지 않은 채였다. 그는 자기 몸이 빌어먹게 좋다고 생각했기 때문에 늘 상체를 드러내고 다녔다. 실제로도 그랬다. 인정할 수밖에 없었다.
나는 특별히 할 일이 없어서, 화장실로 내려가 그 녀석이 면도하는 동안 한담을 나누었다. 게임이 아직 끝나지 않아 모두 그곳에 있었기 때문에 화장실에는 우리 둘뿐이었다. 빌어먹게 더웠고 창문은 온통 김이 서려 있었다. 벽에 딱 붙어 있는 세면대가 열 개쯤 있었다. 스트래드레이터는 가운데 것을 쓰고 있었다. 나는 그 옆 세면대 위에 앉아 차가운 물을 켰다 껐다 하기 시작했다—내가 가진 신경질적인 습관이었다. 스트래드레이터는 면도를 하면서 ‘인도 노래’를 계속 휘파람으로 불었다. 그는 거의 음정이 맞지 않는 그런 귀 따가운 휘파람을 불었고, ‘인도 노래’나 ‘10번가 살육’처럼 휘파람을 잘 부는 사람조차도 불기 어려운 노래만 골라 불렀다. 그는 노래를 완전히 망쳐버릴 수 있었다. 내가 전에 애클리가 개인위생이 지저분한 녀석이라고 말했던 것 기억하나?

### Static Rules Used:
Global Style: Translate the narration in a formal, literary style (문어체). Avoid overly academic or stiff expressions. The tone should be immersive and engaging for a novel reader.

### AI-Generated Guidelines Used:
Key Term Translations:
Annex: 부록
B.M.: 비.엠.
Bud Thaw: 눈 해동
Fitzgerald: 피츠제럴드
Holden: 홀든

Jean Gallagher: 진 갤러거
Phyllis Smith: 필리스 스미스
Shipley: 시플리
Stradlater: 스트래드레이터

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** 이 작품은 홀든 콜필드라는 십대 소년의 시점에서 서술되는 1인칭 화법으로, 매우 구어체적(colloquial)이고 비격식적입니다. 마치 독자에게 직접 이야기하듯 솔직하고 거침없으며, 홀든의 냉소적이고도 불안정한 내면 상태를 가감 없이 보여줍니다. 문어체(literary style)의 사용은 지양하고, 실제 대화하는 듯한 느낌을 살려야 합니다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **1인칭 내적 독백 (First-person internal monologue):** 홀든의 생각, 감정, 비판적인 시각이 여과 없이 드러납니다. 이는 내러티브의 핵심이므로 반드시 보존해야 합니다.
    *   **구어체 및 속어 (Colloquialism/Slang):** "goddam," "hell no," "pig," "crumby," "babe," "screwed up," "horsing around," "crap," "wuddaya" 등 십대들이 사용하는 비속어와 구어적 표현이 풍부합니다. 한국어에서도 유사한 어감과 비격식성을 지닌 표현으로 번역하여 젊은 세대의 언어 사용을 반영해야 합니다.
    *   **강조를 위한 반복 (Repetition for emphasis):** "Boy, I nearly dropped dead... I damn near dropped dead." "I was pretty excited. I really was." 와 같이 특정 감정이나 상황을 강조하기 위한 반복 표현을 살립니다.
    *   **잦은 여담/탈선 (Digressions/Asides):** "That's a wrestling hold, in case you don't know..." 처럼 본론에서 잠시 벗어나 부연 설명을 하거나 개인적인 생각을 덧붙이는 홀든 특유의 화법을 유지합니다.
    *   **과장법 (Hyperbole):** "like a goddam panther," "choke him to death," "nearly dropped dead" 등 과장된 표현을 통해 홀든의 감정 상태를 극대화하여 전달합니다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden (홀든)**
    *   **Speaking to: Stradlater (스트래드레이터)**
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 호기심 많고, 장난기가 넘치며(레슬링 홀드 등), 때로는 도발적이고(피츠제럴드에 대한 언급), 쉽게 흥분하며 특정 주제(제인 갤러거)에 깊이 몰입하는 모습을 보입니다. 감정의 기복이 심하며 솔직합니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 매우 비격식적인 **해체** (해요체의 비격식적 표현) 또는 상황에 따라 직설적인 **해라체**를 사용합니다. (예: "Who's your date?"와 같은 질문은 해체가 적합하지만, "Give her to me, boy. No kidding. She's my type."와 같이 거침없이 제안하거나, "Je-sus Christ." 같은 감탄사는 해라체에 가까운 강한 어조가 어울릴 수 있습니다.) 거침없고 솔직한 십대 소년의 말투를 유지하며, 감탄사나 비속어는 한국어의 유사한 어감으로 표현해야 합니다.

    *   **Speaking to: Self (Internal Monologue/Narration) (내적 독백/서술)**
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 독자에게 직접 이야기하는 듯한 홀든의 개인적인 생각, 판단, 관찰입니다. 냉소적이고 비판적이며, 필터링되지 않은 날것의 감정을 담고 있습니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 일관적으로 직설적이고 비격식적인 **해라체**를 사용합니다. 이는 홀든의 내면세계와 독자 간의 친밀하고 솔직한 연결고리를 형성하는 데 중요합니다.

*   **Character: Stradlater (스트래드레이터)**
    *   **Speaking to: Holden (홀든)**
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 홀든에 비해 침착하지만 여전히 비격식적입니다. 홀든의 장난에 짜증을 내거나(레슬링, 면도 방해), 무시하는 듯한 태도를 보이며("Hell, no!", "She's too old for you," "Cut it out, Holden, for Chrissake!"), 가끔은 당황하거나("Wuddaya wanna make me do--cut my goddam head off?") 무관심한 반응을 보입니다. 자신의 외모에 신경 쓰는 자아도취적인 면모도 있습니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 비격식적인 **해체** 또는 명령이나 짜증을 낼 때는 직설적인 **해라체**를 사용합니다. (예: "Cut it out, Holden, for Chrissake!" 같은 명령조 표현이나 "You're right in my light, Holden, for Chrissake."처럼 불만을 표출하는 경우). 홀든보다 감정 표현이 덜 직접적이지만 여전히 십대 소년의 말투이며, 짜증이나 무관심 등의 감정을 적절히 반영해야 합니다.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
Well,
so was Stradlater, but in a different way. Stradlater was more of a secret slob. He always
looked all right, Stradlater, but for instance, you should've seen the razor he shaved
himself with. It was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap. He never
cleaned it or anything. He always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up,
but he was a secret slob anyway, if you knew him the way I did. The reason he fixed
himself up to look good was because he was madly in love with himself. He thought he
was the handsomest guy in the Western Hemisphere. He was pretty handsome, too--I'll
admit it. But he was mostly the kind of a handsome guy that if your parents saw his
picture in your Year Book, they'd right away say, "Who's this boy?" I mean he was
mostly a Year Book kind of handsome guy. I knew a lot of guys at Pencey I thought were
a lot handsomer than Stradlater, but they wouldn't look handsome if you saw their
pictures in the Year Book. They'd look like they had big noses or their ears stuck out. I've
had that experience frequently. Anyway, I was sitting on the washbowl next to where Stradlater was shaving, sort
of turning the water on and off. I still had my red hunting hat on, with the peak around to
the back and all. I really got a bang out of that hat. "Hey," Stradlater said. "Wanna do me a big favor?"
 "What?" I said. Not too enthusiastic. He was always asking you to do him a big
favor. You take a very handsome guy, or a guy that thinks he's a real hot-shot, and they're
always asking you to do them a big favor. Just because they're crazy about themseif, they
think you're crazy about them, too, and that you're just dying to do them a favor. It's sort
of funny, in a way. "You goin' out tonight?" he said. "I might. I might not. I don't know. Why?"
 "I got about a hundred pages to read for history for Monday," he said. "How 'bout
writing a composition for me, for English? I'll be up the creek if I don't get the goddam
thing in by Monday, the reason I ask. How 'bout it?"
 It was very ironical. It really was. "I'm the one that's flunking out of the goddam place, and you're asking me to
write you a goddam composition," I said. "Yeah, I know. The thing is, though, I'll be up the creek if I don't get it in. Be a
buddy. Be a buddyroo. Okay?"
 I didn't answer him right away. Suspense is good for some bastards like
Stradlater. "What on?" I said. "Anything. Anything descriptive. A room. Or a house. Or something you once
lived in or something-- you know. Just as long as it's descriptive as hell." He gave out a
big yawn while he said that. Which is something that gives me a royal pain in the ass. I
mean if somebody yawns right while they're asking you to do them a goddam favor. "Just
don't do it too good, is all," he said. "That sonuvabitch Hartzell thinks you're a hot-shot in
English, and he knows you're my roommate. So I mean don't stick all the commas and
stuff in the right place."
 That's something else that gives me a royal pain. I mean if you're good at writing
compositions and somebody starts talking about commas. Stradlater was always doing
that. He wanted you to think that the only reason he was lousy at writing compositions
was because he stuck all the commas in the wrong place. He was a little bit like Ackley,
that way. I once sat next to Ackley at this basketball game. We had a terrific guy on the
team, Howie Coyle, that could sink them from the middle of the floor, without even
touching the backboard or anything. Ackley kept saying, the whole goddam game, that
Coyle had a perfect build for basketball. God, how I hate that stuff. I got bored sitting on that washbowl after a while, so I backed up a few feet and
started doing this tap dance, just for the hell of it. I was just amusing myself. I can't really
tap-dance or anything, but it was a stone floor in the can, and it was good for tap-dancing. I started imitating one of those guys in the movies. In one of those musicals. I hate the
movies like poison, but I get a bang imitating them. Old Stradlater watched me in the
mirror while he was shaving. All I need's an audience. I'm an exhibitionist. "I'm the
goddarn Governor's son," I said. I was knocking myself out. Tap-dancing all over the
place. "He doesn't want me to be a tap dancer. He wants me to go to Oxford. But it's in
my goddam blood, tap-dancing." Old Stradlater laughed. He didn't have too bad a sense
of humor. "It's the opening night of the Ziegfeld Follies." I was getting out of breath. I
have hardly any wind at all. "The leading man can't go on. He's drunk as a bastard. So
who do they get to take his place? Me, that's who. The little ole goddam Governor's son."
 "Where'dja get that hat?" Stradlater said. He meant my hunting hat. He'd never
seen it before. I was out of breath anyway, so I quit horsing around. I took off my hat and looked
at it for about the ninetieth time. "I got it in New York this morning. For a buck. Ya like
it?"
 Stradlater nodded. "Sharp," he said. He was only flattering me, though, because
right away he said, "Listen. Are ya gonna write that composition for me?

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
글쎄, 스트래드레이터도 그랬지만, 좀 다른 식이었다. 스트래드레이터는 좀 더 은밀한 지저분한 놈이었다. 스트래드레이터는 늘 멀쩡해 보였지만, 예를 들어, 그 녀석이 면도할 때 쓰는 면도기를 봤어야 했다. 빌어먹게 녹이 슬어 있었고, 비누 거품이랑 털, 온갖 더러운 게 잔뜩 붙어 있었다. 그걸 한 번도 치우는 법이 없었다. 몸단장을 마치고 나면 늘 멋져 보였지만, 나처럼 그 녀석을 아는 사람이라면 어쨌든 은밀한 지저분한 놈이라는 걸 알 수 있었다. 그 녀석이 멋지게 보이려고 몸단장을 하는 이유는 자신을 미치도록 사랑했기 때문이었다. 자기 자신을 서반구에서 제일 잘생긴 놈이라고 생각했다. 꽤 잘생기긴 했다—인정한다. 하지만 그 녀석은 대체로, 부모님이 네 연감에서 그 사진을 보면 바로 ‘얘는 누구니?’라고 물어볼 만한 그런 잘생긴 녀석이었다. 내 말은, 대체로 연감에 나올 법한 잘생긴 녀석이었다는 거다. 펜시에서 스트래드레이터보다 훨씬 더 잘생겼다고 생각했던 녀석들을 많이 알았지만, 연감에서 그 사진을 보면 잘생겨 보이지 않았을 거다. 코가 크거나 귀가 튀어나온 것처럼 보였을 거다. 그런 경험은 자주 있었다.
어쨌든, 나는 스트래드레이터가 면도하는 옆 세면대 위에 앉아 물을 켰다 껐다 하고 있었다. 나는 여전히 빨간 사냥 모자를 쓰고 있었는데, 챙을 뒤로 돌려 쓴 채였다. 나는 그 모자가 정말 마음에 들었다.
“야,” 스트래드레이터가 말했다. “나한테 큰 부탁 하나 해줄래?”
“뭐?” 내가 말했다. 그다지 내키지 않았다. 그 녀석은 늘 큰 부탁을 해달라고 했다. 아주 잘생긴 녀석이나, 자기가 정말 대단하다고 생각하는 녀석들을 보면, 늘 큰 부탁을 해달라고 한다. 자기 자신한테 미쳐 있으니, 남들도 자기한테 미쳐 있고 부탁이라면 뭐든 죽을힘을 다해 들어줄 거라고 생각하는 거다. 어떤 면에선 좀 웃긴 일이다.
“너 오늘 밤에 나갈 거야?” 그가 말했다.
“나갈 수도 있고. 안 나갈 수도 있고. 몰라. 왜?”
“나 월요일까지 역사 숙제 백 쪽 정도 읽어야 하거든.” 그가 말했다. “영어 작문 숙제 좀 나 대신 써주는 거 어때? 월요일까지 그 빌어먹을 걸 내지 않으면 꼼짝 못 할 지경이라서 그래. 어때?”
참 아이러니했다. 정말 그랬다.
“이 빌어먹을 학교에서 낙제해서 쫓겨날 놈은 난데, 나한테 빌어먹을 작문 숙제를 써달라고 하는 거냐.” 내가 말했다.
“응, 알아. 근데 말이야, 그걸 내지 못하면 나 진짜 꼼짝 못 해. 친구 좋다는 게 뭐야. 친구 아니냐. 응?”
나는 바로 대답하지 않았다. 스트래드레이터 같은 개자식들한테는 애태우는 게 약이다.
“뭘 가지고?” 내가 말했다.
“아무거나. 묘사하는 거면 돼. 방이든. 집이든. 아니면 네가 예전에 살았던 곳이든 뭐든—알잖아. 빌어먹게 묘사만 잘 되어 있으면 돼.” 그 말을 하면서 크게 하품을 했다. 그건 나를 빌어먹게 짜증 나게 하는 짓이다. 내 말은, 누가 빌어먹을 부탁을 하면서 하품을 찍찍 한다는 거다. “그냥 너무 잘 쓰지는 마, 그거면 돼.” 그가 말했다. “그 개자식 하첼이 네가 영어에선 잘나가는 놈이라고 생각하고, 네가 내 룸메이트라는 걸 알거든. 그러니까 내 말은, 쉼표 같은 거 죄다 제자리에 박아 넣지 말라는 거야.”
그것도 나를 빌어먹게 짜증 나게 하는 짓이다. 내 말은, 작문을 잘하는데 누가 쉼표 같은 소리를 하기 시작하면 말이야. 스트래드레이터는 늘 그랬다. 자기가 작문을 못하는 유일한 이유가 쉼표를 죄다 엉뚱한 데 박아 넣어서라고 생각하게 만들고 싶어 했다. 그런 면에선 애클리하고 좀 비슷했다. 한번은 농구 경기에서 애클리 옆에 앉은 적이 있었다. 우리 팀에 하위 코일이라는 멋진 녀석이 있었는데, 백보드 같은 데 전혀 건드리지 않고 코트 중앙에서 골을 넣을 수 있었다. 애클리는 빌어먹을 경기 내내 코일이 농구에 완벽한 몸매를 가졌다고 계속 말했다. 젠장, 그런 소리 정말 싫었다.
나는 얼마 지나지 않아 세면대에 앉아 있는 게 지루해져서, 몇 발짝 뒤로 물러나 그냥 재미 삼아 탭댄스를 추기 시작했다. 그냥 나 자신을 즐겁게 하는 중이었다. 내가 탭댄스를 제대로 추는 건 아니었지만, 화장실 바닥이 돌이라 탭댄스 추기엔 좋았다. 영화에 나오는 그런 녀석들 중 하나를 흉내 내기 시작했다. 뮤지컬 영화 말이다. 나는 영화를 죽도록 싫어하지만, 그런 걸 흉내 내는 건 정말 재미있었다. 스트래드레이터는 면도하면서 거울로 나를 지켜봤다. 내게 필요한 건 관객뿐이다. 나는 노출증 환자다.
“내가 이 빌어먹을 주지사 아들이다.” 내가 말했다. 나는 죽어라 춤을 추고 있었다. 온 사방을 돌아다니며 탭댄스를 췄다. “그분은 내가 탭댄서가 되는 걸 원치 않아. 옥스퍼드에 가길 바라지. 하지만 탭댄스는 내 빌어먹을 피 속에 흐른다.” 스트래드레이터는 웃었다. 유머 감각이 아주 나쁘진 않았다. “지그펠드 폴리스의 개막 밤이다.” 나는 숨이 가빠지고 있었다. 숨이 거의 없었다. “주연 배우가 무대에 못 올라와. 개자식처럼 취했거든. 그래서 누가 그 자리를 대신하게 될까? 바로 나다. 조그만 빌어먹을 주지사 아들이.”
“그 모자 어디서 났어?” 스트래드레이터가 말했다. 내 사냥 모자를 말하는 거였다. 그 녀석은 그걸 전에 본 적이 없었다. 어차피 숨도 가빴던 터라, 나는 장난치는 걸 멈췄다. 나는 모자를 벗어 아흔 번째쯤 되는 듯 다시 들여다봤다.
“오늘 아침 뉴욕에서 1달러 주고 샀어. 마음에 드냐?”
스트래드레이터는 고개를 끄덕였다. “멋진데.” 그가 말했다. 하지만 그는 나를 그냥 비위 맞추는 거였다. 왜냐하면 곧바로 이렇게 말했기 때문이다. “들어봐. 그 작문 숙제 나 대신 써줄 거야?”

==================================================

--- CONTEXT FOR SEGMENT 13 ---

### Static Rules Used:
Global Style: Translate the narration in a formal, literary style (문어체). Avoid overly academic or stiff expressions. The tone should be immersive and engaging for a novel reader.

### AI-Generated Guidelines Used:
Key Term Translations:
Ackley: 애클리
Jane: 제인
New York: 뉴욕
Pencey: 펜시
Shipley: 시플리
Stradlater: 스트래드레이터
Thurmer: 써머

Style and Tone Analysis:
Here are the practical, actionable guidelines for translating the provided text segment, focusing on consistent and context-aware tone and speaking style.

### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is informal, highly personal, and conversational, reflecting Holden Caulfield's stream-of-consciousness thoughts and cynical observations. It's often rambling, uses colloquialisms, and is punctuated by exclamations and mild profanity. The overall tone is one of a disaffected, observant, yet often anxious teenager.
    *   **Recommendation:** Primarily use a **구어체 (colloquial style)**. For Holden's direct thoughts and observations, a blend of **해라체 (plain/blunt style)** for direct statements and observations, and **해요체 (informal polite style)** for more reflective or conversational internal monologues, would be appropriate. Ensure the tone is consistently informal and somewhat world-weary. Avoid overly formal or literary Korean (문어체) where a more natural, spoken feel is intended.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Internal Monologue/Stream of Consciousness:** A core element of Holden's narrative. Translate his thoughts and reflections using natural, flowing Korean that mirrors the original's spontaneous feel. Consider using parenthetical clauses or shifting verb endings to differentiate between action and internal thought.
    *   **Colloquialisms/Slang:** Terms like "can" (for bathroom), "willya," "racket" (as in trick/scheme), "bang out" (leave quickly). These need to be rendered with natural, contemporary Korean equivalents that convey a similar level of informality and slightly rebellious youth.
    *   **Profanity:** Words like "goddam," "Chrissake," "hell," "bastard" are used frequently but casually. These should be translated carefully to avoid sounding overly aggressive or archaic in Korean. Options like "젠장," "빌어먹을," "젠장할," "망할" for expletives, and "녀석," "자식," or even "새끼" (used judiciously for "bastard" depending on the context and target audience's sensitivity) can be considered to maintain the original's casual profanity without being jarring.
    *   **Hyperbole & Sarcasm:** Holden often exaggerates ("spent around half his goddam life") and uses sarcasm, especially when describing others. Preserve this tone through appropriate Korean expressions that convey exaggeration or ironic distance.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden Caulfield**
    *   **Speaking to: Stradlater**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** Holden is curious about Jane Gallagher, slightly anxious, and later somewhat confrontational or sarcastic. He seeks information, asks for favors, and occasionally expresses exasperation or cynical judgment. The dynamic is one of peer interaction, sometimes tinged with rivalry or discomfort on Holden's part.
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use **해라체 (plain/blunt style)**. This reflects the close, yet sometimes tense, relationship between male peers of similar age. For questions and direct statements, **해라체** is most natural. When asking a favor ("willya?"), a slightly softer **해라체** ending or an informal **아요/어요 (해요체)** ending might be appropriate, but maintain the overall casual and direct tone.
            *   *Example:* "Did she enjoy the game?" → "게임은 재밌어 했대?" (해라체)
            *   *Example:* "Don't tell her I got kicked out, willya?" → "나 퇴학당했다고는 말하지 마, 알았지?" (해라체)
            *   *Example:* "The reason she did that, she probably just didn't know what a handsome, charming bastard you are." → "걔가 왜 그랬냐면, 네가 얼마나 잘생기고 매력적인 빌어먹을 놈인지 아마 몰랐을 거야." (해라체, sarcastic)
    *   **Speaking to: Self (Narration/Internal Monologue)**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** Reflective, cynical, judgmental, anxious, rambling. Holden's inner world is a mix of observation, opinion, and emotional processing.
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Predominantly **해라체 (plain/blunt style)** for direct observations, judgments, and declarative thoughts. Occasionally, a more conversational **해요체 (informal polite)** can be used to reflect the stream-of-consciousness, as if speaking to an unseen listener. The casual nature of his internal profanity should be mirrored.
            *   *Example:* "I could've sworn she went to Shipley." → "쉽리 갔다고 맹세할 수도 있었는데." (해라체)
            *   *Example:* "You take a guy like Stradlater, they never give your regards to people." → "스트래드래터 같은 놈들은 남의 안부를 절대 전해주지 않는다니까." (해라체, general observation)
            *   *Example:* "He spent around half his goddam life in front of the mirror." → "그 녀석은 거울 앞에서 빌어먹을 인생의 절반은 보낸다고." (해라체, with appropriate expletive)

*   **Character: Stradlater**
    *   **Speaking to: Holden Caulfield**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** Dismissive, casual, slightly annoyed, and conceited. Stradlater is generally uninterested in Holden's concerns and focuses on his own affairs. His responses are often curt or perfunctory.
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use **해라체 (plain/blunt style)**. This clearly conveys his casual, slightly superior, and often dismissive attitude towards Holden within their peer dynamic. His answers should sound unbothered and direct.
            *   *Example:* "Yeah, I guess so. I don't know." → "어, 그런 것 같던데. 몰라." (해라체, curt)
            *   *Example:* "For Chrissake, I only just met her," → "젠장, 이제 막 만났을 뿐인데." (해라체, exasperated)
            *   *Example:* "Listen. Give her my regards, willya?" → "야. 내 안부 좀 전해 줘, 알았지?" (해라체, casual request)
            *   *Example:* "Goddam right," → "빌어먹을, 당연하지." (해라체, conceited)
            *   *Example:* "Don't knock yourself out or anything, but just make it descriptive as hell. Okay?" → "너무 애쓰진 말고, 그냥 빌어먹을 정도로 묘사나 잘 해. 알았냐?" (해라체, casual instruction with expletive)

I have to
know."
 "If I get the time, I will. If I don't, I won't," I said. I went over and sat down at the
washbowl next to him again. "Who's your date?" I asked him. "Fitzgerald?"
 "Hell, no! I told ya. I'm through with that pig."
 "Yeah? Give her to me, boy. No kidding. She's my type."
 "Take her . . . She's too old for you."
 All of a sudden--for no good reason, really, except that I was sort of in the mood
for horsing around--I felt like jumping off the washbowl and getting old Stradlater in a
half nelson. That's a wrestling hold, in case you don't know, where you get the other guy
around the neck and choke him to death, if you feel like it. So I did it. I landed on him
like a goddam panther. "Cut it out, Holden, for Chrissake!" Stradlater said. He didn't feel like horsing
around. He was shaving and all. "Wuddaya wanna make me do--cut my goddam head
off?"
 I didn't let go, though. I had a pretty good half nelson on him. "Liberate yourself
from my viselike grip." I said. "Je-sus Christ." He put down his razor, and all of a sudden jerked his arms up and
sort of broke my hold on him. He was a very strong guy. I'm a very weak guy. "Now, cut
out the crap," he said. He started shaving himself all over again. He always shaved
himself twice, to look gorgeous. With his crumby old razor. "Who is your date if it isn't Fitzgerald?" I asked him. I sat down on the washbowl
next to him again. "That Phyllis Smith babe?"
 "No. It was supposed to he, but the arrangements got all screwed up. I got Bud
Thaw's girl's roommate now . . . Hey. I almost forgot. She knows you."
 "Who does?" I said. "My date."
 "Yeah?" I said. "What's her name?" I was pretty interested. "I'm thinking . . . Uh. Jean Gallagher."
 Boy, I nearly dropped dead when he said that. "Jane Gallagher," I said. I even got up from the washbowl when he said that. I
damn near dropped dead. "You're damn right I know her. She practically lived right next
door to me, the summer before last. She had this big damn Doberman pinscher. That's
how I met her. Her dog used to keep coming over in our--"
 "You're right in my light, Holden, for Chrissake," Stradlater said. "Ya have to
stand right there?"
 Boy, was I excited, though. I really was. "Where is she?" I asked him. "I oughta go down and say hello to her or
something. Where is she? In the Annex?"
 "Yeah."
 "How'd she happen to mention me? Does she go to B.M. now? She said she might
go there. She said she might go to Shipley, too. I thought she went to Shipley. How'd she
happen to mention me?" I was pretty excited. I really was. "I don't know, for Chrissake. Lift up, willya? You're on my towel," Stradlater
said. I was sitting on his stupid towel. "Jane Gallagher," I said. I couldn't get over it. "Jesus H. Christ."
 Old Stradlater was putting Vitalis on his hair. My Vitalis. "She's a dancer," I said. "Ballet and all. She used to practice about two hours
every day, right in the middle of the hottest weather and all. She was worried that it might
make her legs lousy--all thick and all. I used to play checkers with her all the time."
 "You used to play what with her all the time?"
 "Checkers."
 "Checkers, for Chrissake!"
 "Yeah. She wouldn't move any of her kings. What she'd do, when she'd get a king,
she wouldn't move it. She'd just leave it in the back row. She'd get them all lined up in the
back row. Then she'd never use them. She just liked the way they looked when they were
all in the back row."
 Stradlater didn't say anything. That kind of stuff doesn't interest most people. "Her mother belonged to the same club we did," I said. "I used to caddy once in a
while, just to make some dough. I caddy'd for her mother a couple of times. She went
around in about a hundred and seventy, for nine holes."
 Stradlater wasn't hardly listening. He was combing his gorgeous locks. "I oughta go down and at least say hello to her," I said. "Why don'tcha?"
 "I will, in a minute."
 He started parting his hair all over again. It took him about an hour to comb his
hair. "Her mother and father were divorced. Her mother was married again to some
booze hound," I said. "Skinny guy with hairy legs. I remember him. He wore shorts all
the time. Jane said he was supposed to be a playwright or some goddam thing, but all I
ever saw him do was booze all the time and listen to every single goddam mystery
program on the radio. And run around the goddam house, naked. With Jane around, and
all."
 "Yeah?" Stradlater said. That really interested him. About the booze hound
running around the house naked, with Jane around. Stradlater was a very sexy bastard. "She had a lousy childhood. I'm not kidding."
 That didn't interest Stradlater, though. Only very sexy stuff interested him. "Jane Gallagher. Jesus . . . I couldn't get her off my mind. I really couldn't. "I
oughta go down and say hello to her, at least."
 "Why the hell don'tcha, instead of keep saying it?" Stradlater said. I walked over to the window, but you couldn't see out of it, it was so steamy from
all the heat in the can.. "I'm not in the mood right now," I said. I wasn't, either. You have
to be in the mood for those things.

꼭 알아야겠어.
"시간이 되면 할 거고, 안 되면 안 할 거야." 내가 말했다. 다시 그 옆 세면대로 가서 앉았다. "데이트 상대 누구야?" 내가 물었다. "피츠제럴드?"
"젠장, 아니야! 말했잖아. 그 돼지 같은 년이랑은 끝났어."
"응? 나 줘 봐, 야. 농담 아니고. 내 타입이야."
"데려가... 너한테는 너무 나이 많아."
갑자기—딱히 이유랄 것도 없었다. 그냥 좀 장난칠 기분이었을 뿐이었다—세면대에서 뛰어내려 스트래드레이터를 하프 넬슨으로 걸고 싶었다. 혹시 모를까 봐 말인데, 그건 레슬링 기술 중 하나다. 상대방 목을 잡고, 원하면 숨통을 끊어버릴 수도 있는 기술이다. 그래서 그렇게 했다. 빌어먹을 팬서처럼 그에게 달려들었다.
"그만해, 홀든, 제발 좀!" 스트래드레이터가 말했다. 그는 장난칠 기분이 아니었다. 면도 중이었다. "나보고 뭘 하라는 거야—내 빌어먹을 머리를 잘라버리라는 거야?"
하지만 나는 놓지 않았다. 그에게 꽤 제대로 하프 넬슨을 걸었다. "내 강철 같은 손아귀에서 벗어나 봐." 내가 말했다. "젠장."
그는 면도기를 내려놓고 갑자기 팔을 쳐들어 내 손아귀에서 벗어났다. 그는 정말 힘이 센 놈이었다. 나는 정말 힘이 약한 놈이다. "이제 시시한 장난 그만해." 그가 말했다. 그는 다시 면도를 시작했다. 그는 늘 두 번 면도해서 멋지게 보이려고 했다. 그 볼품없는 낡은 면도기로 말이다.
"피츠제럴드가 아니면 네 데이트 상대 누구야?" 내가 그에게 물었다. 다시 그 옆 세면대에 앉았다. "그 필리스 스미스 아가씨?"
"아니. 원래는 그럴 예정이었는데, 일이 다 꼬였어. 지금은 눈 해동 애인 룸메이트랑 가게 됐어... 야. 거의 잊을 뻔했다. 그 애가 너 알아."
"누가?" 내가 말했다. "내 데이트 상대."
"응?" 내가 말했다. "이름이 뭔데?" 나는 꽤 흥분했다.
"생각 중인데... 어... 진 갤러거."
세상에, 그 말을 듣고 거의 쓰러질 뻔했다. "제인 갤러거." 내가 말했다. 그 말을 듣고 세면대에서 벌떡 일어섰다. 정말 쓰러질 뻔했다. "정말 잘 알아. 재작년 여름엔 거의 우리 옆집에 살았어. 빌어먹게 큰 도베르만 핀셔를 키웠거든. 그렇게 만났지. 그 개가 우리 집으로 계속 넘어오곤 했어—"
"홀든, 너 내 빛 가리잖아, 제발 좀." 스트래드레이터가 말했다. "꼭 거기 서 있어야 해?"
세상에, 나는 흥분했다. 정말 그랬다. "어디 있는데?" 내가 그에게 물었다. "내려가서 인사라도 해야겠는데. 어디 있어? 부록에?"
"응."
"어떻게 나를 언급하게 됐어? 지금 비.엠. 다녀? 거기 갈지도 모른다고 했었거든. 시플리 갈지도 모른다고도 했고. 난 시플리 간 줄 알았는데. 어떻게 나를 언급하게 된 거야?" 나는 꽤 흥분했다. 정말 그랬다.
"젠장, 나도 몰라. 좀 비켜 봐, 응? 내 수건 위에 앉아 있잖아." 스트래드레이터가 말했다. 나는 그 녀석의 시시한 수건 위에 앉아 있었다. "제인 갤러거." 나는 잊을 수가 없었다. "이런 젠장."
스트래드레이터는 머리에 바이탈리스를 바르고 있었다. 내 바이탈리스를. "그 애 무용수야. 발레 같은 거 말이야. 매일 두 시간씩 연습하곤 했어, 한여름 땡볕에도 말이야. 다리가 망가질까 봐—두꺼워질까 봐—걱정했지. 그 애랑 늘 체커를 하곤 했어."
"그 애랑 늘 뭘 하곤 했다고?"
"체커."
"젠장, 체커라니!"
"응. 그 애는 자기 킹을 절대 안 움직였어. 킹을 잡으면 말이야, 그걸 움직이지 않았어. 그냥 맨 뒷줄에 뒀지. 그것들을 전부 맨 뒷줄에 줄 세워 놓는 거야. 그러곤 절대 안 썼어. 그냥 맨 뒷줄에 다 놓여 있을 때 그 모습이 좋았대."
스트래드레이터는 아무 말도 하지 않았다. 그런 이야기는 대부분의 사람들에겐 별로 흥미가 없었다. "그 애 엄마가 우리랑 같은 클럽 회원이었어. 나는 가끔 돈 좀 벌려고 캐디를 하곤 했거든. 그 애 엄마 캐디를 몇 번 했어. 아홉 홀에 백칠십 타 정도 쳤지."
스트래드레이터는 거의 듣지도 않았다. 그는 멋진 머리칼을 빗고 있었다. "내려가서 최소한 인사라도 해야겠어." 내가 말했다. "왜 안 해?"
"조금 있다가 할게."
그는 다시 가르마를 타기 시작했다. 머리를 빗는 데 한 시간쯤 걸렸다. "그 애 엄마랑 아빠는 이혼했어. 엄마가 술고래랑 재혼했지. 다리 털 많은 마른 남자였어. 기억해. 늘 반바지만 입고 다녔어. 제인이 말하길 극작가인가 빌어먹을 그런 거라던데, 내가 본 거라곤 맨날 술이나 퍼마시고 라디오에서 나오는 빌어먹을 추리극이나 듣는 것뿐이었어. 그리고 빌어먹을 집 안을 벌거벗고 돌아다녔어. 제인이 있는데도 말이야."
"그래?" 스트래드레이터가 말했다. 그게 그를 정말 흥미롭게 했다. 술고래가 제인이 있는데도 집 안을 벌거벗고 돌아다녔다는 사실이 말이다. 스트래드레이터는 정말 변태 같은 놈이었다. "그 애는 정말 시시한 어린 시절을 보냈어. 농담 아니야."
하지만 그건 스트래드레이터를 흥미롭게 하지 않았다. 오직 아주 야한 것만 그를 흥미롭게 했다. "제인 갤러거. 젠장... 그 애를 머리에서 지울 수가 없었다. 정말 지울 수가 없었다. 내려가서 최소한 인사라도 해야겠어."
"계속 말만 할 게 아니라, 빌어먹을 왜 안 가?" 스트래드레이터가 말했다. 나는 창문 쪽으로 걸어갔지만, 화장실 안의 열기 때문에 김이 잔뜩 서려 밖이 보이지 않았다. "지금은 그럴 기분이 아니야." 내가 말했다. 정말 아니었다. 그런 일은 기분이 내켜야 하는 법이다.

### Static Rules Used:

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is informal, colloquial, and highly conversational, reflecting the first-person perspective of a cynical and world-weary teenager (Holden Caulfield). It exhibits a stream-of-consciousness flow, often deviating from the main topic to include personal observations, judgments, and frustrations. The tone is direct, often blunt, and uses everyday language.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Internal Monologue:** Preserve the natural flow of Holden's thoughts, including his digressions and self-commentary.
    *   **Cynicism & Sarcasm:** Maintain Holden's critical and often sarcastic worldview. His hyperbole (e.g., "about five hours," "about a hundred times") should be rendered to convey his exasperation rather than literal meaning.
    *   **Colloquialisms & Expletives:** Translate phrases like "goddam," "crap," "bastard" with Korean equivalents that convey a similar level of casual exasperation, disdain, or mild offense without becoming overly vulgar (e.g., "젠장할," "빌어먹을," "헛소리," "자식"). The repetition of "goddam" should also be preserved.
    *   **Direct Address to Reader:** The occasional "You'd think..." or "You'd have liked him" directly engages the reader, maintaining the intimate, confessional tone.

**Recommended Speech Style for Narration:** Predominantly use **해체 (hae-che)** for Holden's internal thoughts, observations, and narrative descriptions. This allows for an informal, personal, and conversational tone. For moments of stronger opinion or direct address to the reader, a slightly more direct **해라체 (hae-ra-che)** can be considered if it enhances the bluntness or cynicism, but **해체 (hae-che)** should be the default.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden (Speaker)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Stradlater, Bus driver, Ackley.
    *   **Context/Emotion:**
        *   To Stradlater: Direct and matter-of-fact, reflecting their peer relationship and Holden's familiarity with Stradlater's quirks.
        *   To Bus driver: Slightly defensive and explanatory, but with a basic level of politeness appropriate for addressing a service person.
        *   To Ackley: Initially hinting, then escalating to frustrated and blunt, finally demanding.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   To Stradlater: Use **해체 (hae-che)**. (e.g., "말 브로사드 가." or "말 브로사드가 갈 거야.")
        *   To Bus driver: Use **해요체 (hae-yo-che)** to convey basic politeness while still being direct. (e.g., "아무한테도 안 던지려 했는데요.")
        *   To Ackley: Start with implied **해체 (hae-che)** for hints. When directly telling him to leave, use a firm **해라체 (hae-ra-che)** or a very direct, blunt **해체 (hae-che)** to convey Holden's exasperation and demand. (e.g., "넌 당장 나가야 해." or "좀 나가야겠어.").

*   **Character: Stradlater**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden.
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Slightly demanding, self-important, and casual. His "That bastard..." is a typical, informal expression of annoyance or disdain among peers.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use **해라체 (hae-ra-che)** for his questions and commands, reflecting his slightly dominant or demanding personality among peers. His exclamations should be colloquial.
        *   (e.g., "나 말고 누가 가는데?" / "그 자식... 됐어. 잠깐만."). "그 자식" or "그 새끼" could be used for "That bastard," depending on the desired intensity, with "그 자식" being a common and suitable choice among young men.

*   **Character: Ackley**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden (monologue, not a true conversation).
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Monotonous, self-absorbed, boastful (falsely so), and oblivious to Holden's discomfort. The content of his speech is fabricated.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** While no direct quotes are provided, the *description* of his speech is crucial. Translate his "talking in this very monotonous voice" and his "crap" stories to reflect their dullness and unconvincing nature. The content of his boasts should be rendered using **해체 (hae-che)**, but the overall impression should be one of awkward, repetitive, and unbelievable narrative. The translator should focus on making his dialogue sound as tedious and uninspired as Holden describes it.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
"I thought she went to Shipley. I could've sworn she
went to Shipley." I walked around the can for a little while. I didn't have anything else to
do. "Did she enjoy the game?" I said. "Yeah, I guess so. I don't know."
 "Did she tell you we used to play checkers all the time, or anything?"
 "I don't know. For Chrissake, I only just met her," Stradlater said. He was finished
combing his goddam gorgeous hair. He was putting away all his crumby toilet articles. "Listen. Give her my regards, willya?"
 "Okay," Stradlater said, but I knew he probably wouldn't. You take a guy like
Stradlater, they never give your regards to people. He went back to the room, but I stuck around in the can for a while, thinking
about old Jane. Then I went back to the room, too. Stradlater was putting on his tie, in front of the mirror, when I got there. He spent
around half his goddam life in front of the mirror. I sat down in my chair and sort of
watched him for a while. "Hey," I said. "Don't tell her I got kicked out, willya?"
 "Okay."
 That was one good thing about Stradlater. You didn't have to explain every
goddam little thing with him, the way you had to do with Ackley. Mostly, I guess,
because he wasn't too interested. That's really why. Ackley, it was different. Ackley was
a very nosy bastard. He put on my hound's-tooth jacket. "Jesus, now, try not to stretch it all over the place" I said. I'd only worn it about
twice. "I won't. Where the hell's my cigarettes?"
 "On the desk." He never knew where he left anything. "Under your muffler." He
put them in his coat pocket--my coat pocket. I pulled the peak of my hunting hat around to the front all of a sudden, for a
change. I was getting sort of nervous, all of a sudden. I'm quite a nervous guy. "Listen,
where ya going on your date with her?" I asked him. "Ya know yet?"
 "I don't know. New York, if we have time. She only signed out for nine-thirty, for
Chrissake."
 I didn't like the way he said it, so I said, "The reason she did that, she probably
just didn't know what a handsome, charming bastard you are. If she'd known, she
probably would've signed out for nine-thirty in the morning."
 "Goddam right," Stradlater said. You couldn't rile him too easily. He was too
conceited. "No kidding, now. Do that composition for me," he said. He had his coat on,
and he was all ready to go. "Don't knock yourself out or anything, but just make it
descriptive as hell. Okay?"
 I didn't answer him. I didn't feel like it. All I said was, "Ask her if she still keeps
all her kings in the back row."
 "Okay," Stradlater said, but I knew he wouldn't. "Take it easy, now." He banged
the hell out of the room. I sat there for about a half hour after he left. I mean I just sat in my chair, not
doing anything. I kept thinking about Jane, and about Stradlater having a date with her
and all. It made me so nervous I nearly went crazy. I already told you what a sexy bastard
Stradlater was. All of a sudden, Ackley barged back in again, through the damn shower curtains,
as usual. For once in my stupid life, I was really glad to see him. He took my mind off the
other stuff. He stuck around till around dinnertime, talking about all the guys at Pencey that
he hated their guts, and squeezing this big pimple on his chin. He didn't even use his
handkerchief. I don't even think the bastard had a handkerchief, if you want to know the
truth. I never saw him use one, anyway. 5
 We always had the same meal on Saturday nights at Pencey. It was supposed to
be a big deal, because they gave you steak. I'll bet a thousand bucks the reason they did
that was because a lot of guys' parents came up to school on Sunday, and old Thurmer
probably figured everybody's mother would ask their darling boy what he had for dinner
last night, and he'd say, "Steak." What a racket. You should've seen the steaks. They were
these little hard, dry jobs that you could hardly even cut. You always got these very
lumpy mashed potatoes on steak night, and for dessert you got Brown Betty, which
nobody ate, except maybe the little kids in the lower school that didn't know any better--
and guys like Ackley that ate everything. It was nice, though, when we got out of the dining room. There were about three
inches of snow on the ground, and it was still coming down like a madman. It looked
pretty as hell, and we all started throwing snowballs and horsing around all over the
place. It was very childish, but everybody was really enjoying themselves. I didn't have a date or anything, so I and this friend of mine, Mal Brossard, that
was on the wrestling team, decided we'd take a bus into Agerstown and have a hamburger
and maybe see a lousy movie. Neither of us felt like sitting around on our ass all night. I
asked Mal if he minded if Ackley came along with us. The reason I asked was because
Ackley never did anything on Saturday night, except stay in his room and squeeze his
pimples or something. Mal said he didn't mind but that he wasn't too crazy about the idea. He didn't like Ackley much. Anyway, we both went to our rooms to get ready and all,
and while I was putting on my galoshes and crap, I yelled over and asked old Ackley if
he wanted to go to the movies.

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
난 걔가 쉽리 간 줄 알았어. 맹세코 쉽리 간 줄 알았는데. 나는 한동안 화장실 안을 서성였다. 딱히 할 일이 없었다. "게임은 재밌어 했대?" 내가 물었다.
"어, 그런 것 같던데. 몰라."
"우리 늘 체커 했었다는 얘기나 그런 건 안 하던?"
"몰라. 젠장, 이제 막 만났을 뿐인데." 스트래드레이터가 말했다. 그는 빌어먹을 멋진 머리칼을 다 빗고 있었다. 그리고 시시한 세면도구들을 모두 정리하고 있었다.
"야. 내 안부 좀 전해 줘, 알았지?"
"알았어." 스트래드레이터가 말했다, 하지만 나는 그가 아마 안 그럴 거란 걸 알았다. 스트래드레이터 같은 놈들은 남의 안부를 절대 전해주지 않는다니까.
그는 방으로 돌아갔지만, 나는 한동안 화장실에 남아 제인 생각을 했다. 그러고 나서 나도 방으로 돌아갔다. 내가 돌아왔을 때 스트래드레이터는 거울 앞에서 넥타이를 매고 있었다. 그 녀석은 빌어먹을 인생의 절반은 거울 앞에서 보낸다고. 나는 내 의자에 앉아 한동안 그를 지켜봤다.
"야." 내가 말했다. "나 퇴학당했다고는 말하지 마, 알았지?"
"알았어."
그건 스트래드레이터의 한 가지 좋은 점이었다. 애클리에게 그랬던 것처럼 빌어먹을 사소한 것 하나하나를 그에게 설명할 필요가 없었다. 아마도 그가 별로 관심이 없었기 때문일 것이다. 정말 그렇다. 애클리는 달랐다. 애클리는 정말 참견하기 좋아하는 녀석이었다. 그는 내 하운드투스 재킷을 입었다.
"젠장, 이제, 여기저기 늘이지 좀 마." 내가 말했다. 나는 그걸 겨우 두 번 정도 입었을 뿐이었다.
"안 그럴 거야. 젠장, 내 담배 어디 있어?"
"책상 위에." 그 녀석은 자기가 뭘 어디에 뒀는지 한 번도 몰랐다. "목도리 밑에." 그는 담배를 자기 코트 주머니—내 코트 주머니—에 넣었다.
나는 갑자기 기분 전환 삼아 사냥모자 챙을 앞으로 돌렸다. 나는 갑자기 좀 긴장되기 시작했다. 나는 꽤 긴장이 많은 녀석이다.
"야, 걔랑 데이트하러 어디 갈 건데?" 내가 물었다. "벌써 알아?"
"몰라. 시간 되면 뉴욕. 젠장, 걔 겨우 9시 반까지 외출 허락받았거든."
나는 그 녀석의 말하는 방식이 마음에 들지 않아 말했다. "걔가 왜 그랬냐면, 네가 얼마나 잘생기고 매력적인 빌어먹을 녀석인지 아마 몰랐을 거야. 알았더라면 아마 아침 9시 반까지 외출 허락받았을걸."
"빌어먹을, 당연하지." 스트래드레이터가 말했다. 그 녀석은 너무 쉽게 화를 내지 않았다. 너무 자만심이 강했으니까.
"농담 말고. 내 작문 좀 해 줘." 그가 말했다. 그는 코트를 입고 막 나갈 채비를 마쳤다. "너무 애쓰진 말고, 그냥 빌어먹을 정도로 묘사나 잘 해. 알았냐?"
나는 대답하지 않았다. 그럴 기분이 아니었다. 내가 말한 건 오직 "걔가 아직도 자기 킹들을 맨 뒷줄에 다 놓는지 물어봐 줘." 뿐이었다.
"알았어." 스트래드레이터가 말했다, 하지만 나는 그가 안 그럴 거란 걸 알았다. "잘 있어." 그는 쾅 하고 방을 나섰다.
그 녀석이 나간 뒤 나는 거기 앉아 삼십 분쯤 있었다. 그러니까 그냥 의자에 앉아 아무것도 하지 않았다. 나는 계속 제인 생각을 했고, 스트래드레이터가 걔랑 데이트하는 것에 대해서도 생각했다. 너무 긴장돼서 미칠 지경이었다. 스트래드레이터가 얼마나 변태 같은 녀석인지 이미 말해줬지.
갑자기 애클리가 늘 그렇듯이 빌어먹을 샤워 커튼을 헤치고 다시 불쑥 들어왔다. 내 시시한 인생에서 처음으로, 나는 그를 정말 반가워했다. 그는 다른 생각들에서 내 정신을 돌려주었다. 그는 저녁 식사 시간까지 주위에 머물며 펜시에서 뼛속까지 싫어하는 녀석들에 대해 떠들었고, 자기 턱에 난 큰 여드름을 짜고 있었다. 손수건도 쓰지 않았다. 솔직히 말해서 그 녀석은 손수건 같은 건 아예 없는 것 같았다. 어쨌든 그가 손수건을 쓰는 걸 본 적이 없다.
펜시에서는 토요일 밤마다 늘 같은 식사를 했다. 스테이크를 줬기 때문에 대단한 것처럼 여겨졌다. 아마도 그들이 그렇게 한 이유는 일요일에 많은 녀석들의 부모가 학교에 오기 때문일 거라고 천 달러 걸 수도 있다. 늙은 써머는 모든 엄마가 자기 예쁜 아들에게 지난밤 저녁으로 뭘 먹었냐고 물을 거고, 아들은 "스테이크요."라고 답할 거라고 생각했을 것이다. 정말 얍삽한 속임수였다. 그 스테이크를 봤어야 했다. 작고 딱딱하고 말라서 거의 자를 수도 없는 것들이었다. 스테이크가 나오는 밤에는 늘 덩어리진 매시트 포테이토가 나왔고, 디저트로는 브라운 베티가 나왔는데, 초등부의 아무것도 모르는 어린애들이나 애클리처럼 뭐든 먹는 녀석들 외에는 아무도 먹지 않았다.
그래도 식당에서 나왔을 때는 좋았다. 땅에는 약 3인치 정도 눈이 쌓여 있었고, 미친 듯이 계속 내리고 있었다. 빌어먹을 정도로 예뻐 보였고, 우리는 모두 눈싸움을 하고 여기저기서 장난을 치기 시작했다. 아주 유치했지만, 모두들 정말 즐거워했다.
나는 데이트 상대도 없었고 아무것도 없었기 때문에, 레슬링 팀에 있던 친구 맬 브로사드와 나는 애저스타운으로 버스를 타고 가서 햄버거를 먹고 어쩌면 시시한 영화나 보자고 결정했다. 우리 둘 다 밤새도록 빈둥거리고 앉아 있고 싶지는 않았다. 나는 맬에게 애클리가 우리랑 같이 가도 괜찮은지 물었다. 내가 물어본 이유는 애클리가 토요일 밤에는 자기 방에 틀어박혀 여드름이나 짜는 것 외에는 아무것도 하지 않았기 때문이었다. 맬은 상관없다고 했지만, 그 생각이 아주 마음에 드는 건 아니라고 했다. 그는 애클리를 별로 좋아하지 않았다. 어쨌든, 우리는 둘 다 준비를 하러 각자 방으로 갔고, 내가 장화 같은 것들을 신고 있는 동안, 나는 소리쳐서 늙은 애클리에게 영화 보러 갈 거냐고 물었다.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style

*   **Overall Tone:** 이 발췌문은 홀든 콜필드(Holden Caulfield)의 1인칭 시점으로 서술되며, 매우 사적이고 내밀한 독백체(internal monologue)를 특징으로 합니다. 전반적으로 냉소적이고 비관적이며, 세상을 비판적으로 바라보는 시선이 두드러지지만, 그 이면에 깊은 슬픔과 상실감, 불안감이 깔려 있습니다. 문장은 구어체(colloquial style)적이며, 비격식적이고 다소 거칠고 꾸밈없는 십대 소년의 목소리를 담고 있습니다. 독자에게 직접 말을 거는 듯한 친밀하고 고백적인 어조가 자주 나타납니다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **독백체 (Internal Monologue):** 홀든의 생각과 감정의 흐름을 여과 없이 보여주는 방식이 핵심입니다. 문장의 끊김, 비문, 반복 등을 의도적으로 살려 홀든의 불안정한 심리 상태와 의식의 흐름을 표현해야 합니다. 한국어 번역 시 홀든의 내면을 그대로 옮기는 듯한 자연스러운 구어체 **해라체**를 기본으로 하되, 문맥에 따라 과도한 어미 사용을 지양하고 담담하거나 무심한 듯한 어조를 유지해야 합니다.
    *   **반복 (Repetition):** 특정 단어나 구절(예: "goddam," "I swear I can't remember")의 반복을 통해 홀든의 강박적이거나 감정적인 상태를 드러냅니다. 한국어 번역 시 자연스러운 반복 표현 또는 강조 표현으로 대체하여 원문의 뉘앙스를 살려야 합니다.
    *   **구어체적 비속어/강조어 (Colloquialisms/Expletives):** "goddam," "for the hell of it," "sonuvabitch" 등 일상적이고 다소 거친 표현들이 자주 사용됩니다. 이를 한국어의 자연스러운 비속어, 욕설, 강조어 등으로 유연하게 번역하되, 홀든의 캐릭터성을 해치지 않도록 강도를 조절해야 합니다. (예: "빌어먹을," "젠장할," "지랄," "제기랄," 또는 문맥에 따라 강조하는 부사 등으로 대체)
    *   **직접적인 독자 호소 (Direct Address to Reader):** "you didn't know Allie," "If you knew Stradlater" 등 독자에게 직접 말을 거는 듯한 표현들을 통해 친밀감과 고백적인 분위기를 조성합니다. 이 부분 또한 **해라체**를 사용하여 독자와의 거리를 가깝게 표현합니다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: 홀든 (Holden)**
    *   **Speaking to:** 스트래들레이터 (Stradlater)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 스트래들레이터의 질문에 마지못해 대답하는 상황입니다. 감정적으로는 스트래들레이터에 대한 불만과 귀찮음이 깔려 있으며, 무관심한 듯하면서도 신경질적인 태도를 보입니다. 짧고 건조하게 응대합니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 또래에게 사용하는 **해라체 (해)** 또는 **반말**을 사용하되, 감정적으로는 다소 무뚝뚝하고 귀찮아하는 듯한 어조를 유지합니다. 문장을 짧게 끊어 홀든의 불성실한 태도를 드러낼 수 있습니다. 'goddam'은 젠장, 빌어먹을 등으로 번역하여 원문의 짜증과 강조를 살립니다.
        *   (예시: "젠장할, 네 침대 위에 있다고 했지.")

*   **Character: 스트래들레이터 (Stradlater)**
    *   **Speaking to:** 홀든 (Holden)
    *   **Context/Emotion:**
        *   첫 대사: 방에 아무도 없는 것에 대한 불평과 짜증입니다. 약간의 오만함과 불만을 내비치며 주변 상황을 타박하는 어조입니다.
        *   두 번째 대사: 홀든의 작문 내용을 확인하고 당황하며 비판하는 어조입니다. 'For Chrissake'를 통해 강한 불쾌감과 불신을 드러냅니다. 자신이 기대한 것과 다른 내용에 대한 짜증이 섞여 있습니다. 스트래들레이터의 본래 성격(오만하고 무례하며 자기중심적인)을 반영해야 합니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 홀든과 같은 또래이지만, 스트래들레이터가 홀든보다 나이도 많고 (스스로 생각하기에) 우월한 위치에 있다고 여기는 캐릭터임을 고려하여, 친구에게 쓰는 **해라체 (해)** 또는 **반말**을 사용합니다. 홀든에게 명령하거나 깔보는 듯한 뉘앙스를 담을 수 있습니다. 'goddam'과 'For Chrissake'는 '젠장', '빌어먹을', '제기랄' 등 강한 표현으로 번역하여 스트래들레이터의 불쾌감과 짜증을 강조합니다.
        *   (예시: "젠장, 다들 어딜 간 거야? 여기 완전 공동묘지 같잖아.")
        *   (예시: "이런 젠장, 홀든! 이거 빌어먹을 야구...")

### Immediate Context Used (English):
He could hear me all right through the shower curtains,
but he didn't answer me right away. He was the kind of a guy that hates to answer you
right away. Finally he came over, through the goddam curtains, and stood on the shower
ledge and asked who was going besides me. He always had to know who was going. I
swear, if that guy was shipwrecked somewhere, and you rescued him in a goddam boat,
he'd want to know who the guy was that was rowing it before he'd even get in. I told him
Mal Brossard was going. He said, "That bastard . . . All right. Wait a second." You'd
think he was doing you a big favor. It took him about five hours to get ready. While he was doing it, I went over to
my window and opened it and packed a snowball with my bare hands. The snow was
very good for packing. I didn't throw it at anything, though. I started to throw it. At a car
that was parked across the street. But I changed my mind. The car looked so nice and
white. Then I started to throw it at a hydrant, but that looked too nice and white, too. Finally I didn't throw it at anything. All I did was close the window and walk around the
room with the snowball, packing it harder. A little while later, I still had it with me when
I and Brossnad and Ackley got on the bus. The bus driver opened the doors and made me
throw it out. I told him I wasn't going to chuck it at anybody, but he wouldn't believe me. People never believe you. Brossard and Ackley both had seen the picture that was playing, so all we did, we
just had a couple of hamburgers and played the pinball machine for a little while, then
took the bus back to Pencey. I didn't care about not seeing the movie, anyway. It was
supposed to be a comedy, with Cary Grant in it, and all that crap. Besides, I'd been to the
movies with Brossard and Ackley before. They both laughed like hyenas at stuff that
wasn't even funny. I didn't even enjoy sitting next to them in the movies. It was only about a quarter to nine when we got back to the dorm. Old Brossard
was a bridge fiend, and he started looking around the dorm for a game. Old Ackley
parked himself in my room, just for a change. Only, instead of sitting on the arm of
Stradlater's chair, he laid down on my bed, with his face right on my pillow and all. He
started talking in this very monotonous voice, and picking at all his pimples. I dropped
about a thousand hints, but I couldn't get rid of him. All he did was keep talking in this
very monotonous voice about some babe he was supposed to have had sexual intercourse
with the summer before. He'd already told me about it about a hundred times. Every time
he told it, it was different. One minute he'd be giving it to her in his cousin's Buick, the
next minute he'd be giving it to her under some boardwalk. It was all a lot of crap,
naturally. He was a virgin if ever I saw one. I doubt if he ever even gave anybody a feel. Anyway, finally I had to come right out and tell him that I had to write a composition for
Stradlater, and that he had to clear the hell out, so I could concentrate. He finally did, but
he took his time about it, as usual. After he left, I put on my pajamas and bathrobe and
my old hunting hat, and started writing the composition. The thing was, I couldn't think of a room or a house or anything to describe the
way Stradlater said he had to have. I'm not too crazy about describing rooms and houses
anyway. So what I did, I wrote about my brother Allie's baseball mitt. It was a very
descriptive subject. It really was. My brother Allie had this left-handed fielder's mitt. He
was left-handed. The thing that was descriptive about it, though, was that he had poems
written all over the fingers and the pocket and everywhere. In green ink. He wrote them
on it so that he'd have something to read when he was in the field and nobody was up at
bat. He's dead now. He got leukemia and died when we were up in Maine, on July 18,
1946. You'd have liked him. He was two years younger than I was, but he was about fifty
times as intelligent. He was terrifically intelligent. His teachers were always writing
letters to my mother, telling her what a pleasure it was having a boy like Allie in their
class. And they weren't just shooting the crap. They really meant it. But it wasn't just that
he was the most intelligent member in the family. He was also the nicest, in lots of ways. He never got mad at anybody. People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily,
but Allie never did, and he had very red hair. I'll tell you what kind of red hair he had. I
started playing golf when I was only ten years old. I remember once, the summer I was
around twelve, teeing off and all, and having a hunch that if I turned around all of a
sudden, I'd see Allie. So I did, and sure enough, he was sitting on his bike outside the
fence--there was this fence that went all around the course--and he was sitting there,
about a hundred and fifty yards behind me, watching me tee off. That's the kind of red
hair he had. God, he was a nice kid, though. He used to laugh so hard at something he
thought of at the dinner table that he just about fell off his chair.

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
샤워 커튼 너머로 내 목소리가 잘 들렸을 텐데, 그는 곧바로 대답하지 않았다. 그 녀석은 바로 대답하는 걸 싫어하는 종류의 인간이었다. 마침내 그는 빌어먹을 커튼을 헤치고 다가와 샤워 턱에 서서 나 말고 누가 가는지 물었다. 그는 늘 누가 가는지 알아야만 했다. 맹세컨대, 그 녀석이 어딘가에 난파되어서 빌어먹을 배로 구해줬다 한들, 배에 타기도 전에 노 젓는 녀석이 누구인지 알고 싶어 할 거다. 나는 말 브로사드가 간다고 말했다. 그가 말했다. "그 자식... 알았어. 잠깐만." 꼭 자기한테 큰 은혜라도 베푸는 것처럼 보였다.
그는 준비하는 데 거의 다섯 시간이나 걸렸다. 그가 준비하는 동안, 나는 창가로 가서 창문을 열고 맨손으로 눈덩이를 뭉쳤다. 눈은 뭉치기 아주 좋았다. 하지만 난 아무 데도 던지지 않았다. 던지려 했다. 길 건너편에 주차된 차에다. 그러나 마음을 바꿨다. 그 차는 너무 멋지고 하얗게 보였다. 그러고 나서 소화전에 던지려 했지만, 그것도 너무 멋지고 하얗게 보였다. 결국 나는 아무 데도 던지지 않았다. 내가 한 일은 창문을 닫고 눈덩이를 들고 방 안을 돌아다니며 더 단단하게 뭉치는 것뿐이었다. 잠시 후, 나와 브로스나드, 애클리가 버스에 탔을 때도 나는 여전히 눈덩이를 가지고 있었다. 버스 기사가 문을 열더니 나보고 눈덩이를 버리라고 했다. 나는 아무한테도 던지지 않을 거라고 말했지만, 그는 나를 믿어주지 않았다. 사람들은 절대 당신을 믿지 않는다.
브로스나드와 애클리 둘 다 상영 중인 영화를 이미 봤었기 때문에, 우리는 그냥 햄버거 몇 개 먹고 핀볼 게임을 잠시 하다가 다시 펜시로 버스를 타고 돌아왔다. 어쨌든 나는 영화를 못 본 것에 신경 쓰지 않았다. 캐리 그랜트가 나오고 뭐 그런 빌어먹을 코미디라고 했다. 게다가 브로스나드와 애클리랑은 전에 영화를 보러 간 적도 있었다. 그 둘은 웃기지도 않은 것에 하이에나처럼 웃어댔다. 영화관에서 그들 옆에 앉아 있는 것도 즐겁지 않았다.
기숙사로 돌아왔을 때는 겨우 아홉 시 십오 분 전쯤이었다. 늙은 브로스나드는 브리지 게임에 미쳐 있었고, 기숙사 안에서 게임 상대를 찾아다니기 시작했다. 늙은 애클리는 기분 전환 삼아 내 방에 눌러앉았다. 다만 스트래드레이터의 의자 팔걸이에 앉는 대신, 그는 내 침대에 얼굴을 내 베개에 바싹 대고 누웠다. 그는 매우 단조로운 목소리로 떠들기 시작했고, 자기 여드름을 모조리 뜯고 있었다. 나는 한 천 가지 정도 힌트를 줬지만, 그 녀석을 떨쳐낼 수 없었다. 그 녀석은 그저 지난여름에 자기가 관계를 가졌다는 여자에 대해 그 매우 단조로운 목소리로 계속 떠들어댔다. 그 녀석은 이미 백 번도 넘게 내게 그 얘길 했었다. 매번 그 얘길 할 때마다 달랐다. 한순간에는 사촌의 뷰익 안에서 그녀와 관계를 맺었다고 하다가, 다음 순간에는 어떤 해변 산책로 밑에서 그랬다고 했다. 물론 그건 전부 헛소리였다. 내가 본 사람 중 가장 순진한 녀석이었다. 그 녀석이 누구한테 손이라도 대본 적이 있을까 싶다.
어쨌든, 결국 나는 스트래드레이터를 위해 작문을 써야 하고, 집중할 수 있게 그 녀석이 당장 나가줘야 한다고 솔직히 말해야 했다. 그는 마침내 나갔지만, 늘 그렇듯이 꾸물거렸다. 그가 나간 뒤, 나는 잠옷과 가운, 그리고 낡은 사냥모자를 쓰고 작문을 쓰기 시작했다. 문제는 스트래드레이터가 반드시 필요하다고 말한 대로 묘사할 만한 방이나 집이나 그 어떤 것도 생각나지 않았다는 것이다. 어쨌든 나는 방이나 집을 묘사하는 걸 별로 좋아하지 않는다. 그래서 나는 내 동생 앨리의 야구 글러브에 대해 썼다. 아주 묘사하기 좋은 주제였다. 정말 그랬다. 내 동생 앨리는 왼손잡이 야수용 글러브를 가지고 있었다. 그는 왼손잡이였다. 하지만 그 글러브가 묘사하기 좋았던 점은 글러브의 손가락 부분, 주머니, 그리고 온갖 곳에 시가 쓰여 있었다는 것이다. 초록색 잉크로. 그는 들판에 있을 때, 그리고 아무도 타석에 없을 때 읽을 거리가 있도록 거기에 시를 썼다.
그는 지금 죽었다. 그는 1946년 7월 18일, 우리가 메인에 있을 때 백혈병에 걸려 죽었다. 당신도 그를 좋아했을 것이다. 그는 나보다 두 살 어렸지만, 지능은 거의 오십 배는 더 뛰어났다. 그는 엄청나게 똑똑했다. 그의 선생님들은 늘 우리 엄마에게 편지를 써서 앨리 같은 아이가 자기들 반에 있는 것이 얼마나 큰 기쁨이었는지 말하곤 했다. 그리고 그들은 그냥 헛소리를 지껄인 게 아니었다. 정말 진심이었다. 하지만 그가 가족 중 가장 똑똑한 멤버였을 뿐만은 아니었다. 여러모로 가장 착한 아이이기도 했다. 그는 누구에게도 화를 내지 않았다. 빨간 머리를 가진 사람들은 아주 쉽게 화를 낸다고들 하지만, 앨리는 절대 그러지 않았고, 그는 아주 빨간 머리를 가지고 있었다. 그가 어떤 빨간 머리였는지 말해줄게. 나는 열 살 때부터 골프를 치기 시작했다. 한번은 열두 살쯤 되던 여름, 티샷을 하고 있는데, 갑자기 뒤를 돌아보면 앨리가 보일 거라는 예감이 들었던 적이 있다. 그래서 그렇게 했더니, 과연 그는 울타리 밖에—골프 코스 전체를 둘러싼 울타리였다—자기 자전거에 앉아 있었다. 나보다 약 백오십 야드 뒤에 앉아서 내가 티샷 하는 걸 보고 있었다. 그게 그 녀석이 가졌던 빨간 머리였다. 젠장, 그래도 그는 정말 착한 아이였다. 그는 저녁 식사 자리에서 문득 떠오른 생각에 너무 크게 웃어서 의자에서 거의 떨어질 뻔하기도 했다.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is highly informal, colloquial (구어체), and conversational, capturing the stream of consciousness of a rebellious and cynical teenager, Holden Caulfield. It is deeply subjective, often reflecting Holden's frustrations, disdain, and anxiety. The language is raw, unfiltered, and uses frequent interjections and expletives, giving it a direct, confessional, and slightly unpolished feel. It should sound like a young male speaking directly to the reader, recounting events with vivid, often exaggerated, emotion.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Internal Monologue (독백체):** A significant portion of the narration consists of Holden's direct, unfiltered thoughts, judgments, and emotional reactions. This should be preserved with a highly informal and subjective tone.
    *   **Colloquialism & Slang:** Extensive use of informal language, contractions, and expletives ("goddam," "hell," "damn," "bastard," "crumby"). These serve to define Holden's voice and must be translated with appropriate Korean equivalents that maintain the same level of informality and emotional weight without sounding overly strong or weak for the context.
    *   **Repetition:** Phrases like "God, how I hated him" or "damn toenails" are repeated, emphasizing Holden's fixations, obsessions, and emotional state. This repetition should be maintained where natural in Korean to convey the same effect.
    *   **Hyperbole:** Exaggeration is common ("weighed about a ton," "sock him, with all my might, right smack in the toothbrush, so it would split his goddam throat open").
    *   **Sarcasm/Cynicism:** An underlying current of sarcasm and cynical observations about people and the world.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden (Narrator/Speaker)**
    *   **Speaking to: Stradlater**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** Holden is increasingly anxious, suspicious, and frustrated, trying to pry information about Jane out of Stradlater. His questions become more insistent, accusatory, and desperate, culminating in anger, physical aggression, and a moment of near-bawling vulnerability. His voice is described as shaking.
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use a highly informal and direct **해라체 (hae-ra-che)**. This should convey his agitation, suspicion, anger, and the underlying vulnerability.
            *   **Questions:** Employ interrogative forms of 해라체 (e.g., ~니?, ~냐?, ~어?).
            *   **Accusations/Demands:** Use strong declarative or imperative forms of 해라체 (e.g., ~해!, ~라!).
            *   **Expletives/Insults:** Translate "goddam," "hell," "bastard," "crumby" with Korean equivalents that reflect a teenager's raw, frustrated, and sometimes vulgar language (e.g., 젠장, 빌어먹을, 망할, 도대체, 지랄 같은, 개자식, 재수 없는 놈). The intensity should increase with Holden's emotional state.
            *   When expressing his near-bawling state, reflect this vulnerability even within the 해라체, perhaps through word choice or sentence structure that conveys a cracking voice or desperate plea.

    *   **Speaking to: Self (Internal Monologue)**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** Expressing strong internal feelings, judgments, and observations about Stradlater, the situation, or the school environment ("God, how I hated him," "The hell he did, the bastard," "What a school").
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Maintain a highly informal and subjective **해체 (hae-che)** or **독백체 (dokbaek-che)**. These thoughts are raw and unfiltered. Strong exclamatory or declarative forms should be used where appropriate to convey the intensity of his feelings.

*   **Character: Stradlater**
    *   **Speaking to: Holden**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** Stradlater is initially nonchalant, dismissive, and slightly arrogant. He answers curtly, showing impatience or contempt. Later, he becomes playfully antagonistic (poking Holden), then shifts to anger and physical dominance after Holden attacks him. He is generally self-assured and unbothered by Holden's prodding.
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Primarily use a casual yet slightly condescending **해라체 (hae-ra-che)**.
            *   **Casual/Dismissive:** Use short, blunt phrases that convey his nonchalance (e.g., "쿠플라 미니츠," "누가 토요일 밤에 아홉 시 반에 나가냐?").
            *   **Condescending/Impatient:** When giving advice or warnings (e.g., about smoking), use a slightly more authoritative or exasperated 해라체.
            *   **Taunting/Superior:** When he says, "That's a professional secret, buddy," or makes playful jabs, the tone should be mocking or superior.
            *   **Angry/Dominant:** After being attacked, his "What the hell's the matter with you?" should be a mix of anger, confusion, and a display of physical superiority, still conveyed through 해라체.
            *   **Expletives:** Translate "hell" and "Chrissake" with Korean equivalents that reflect informal exasperation or annoyance, but generally less intense than Holden's usage, fitting Stradlater's more controlled (though still aggressive) demeanor.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
I was only thirteen, and
they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all, because I broke all the windows in
the garage. I don't blame them. I really don't. I slept in the garage the night he died, and I
broke all the goddam windows with my fist, just for the hell of it. I even tried to break all
the windows on the station wagon we had that summer, but my hand was already broken
and everything by that time, and I couldn't do it. It was a very stupid thing to do, I'll
admit, but I hardly didn't even know I was doing it, and you didn't know Allie. My hand
still hurts me once in a while when it rains and all, and I can't make a real fist any more--
not a tight one, I mean--but outside of that I don't care much. I mean I'm not going to be a
goddam surgeon or a violinist or anything anyway. Anyway, that's what I wrote Stradlater's composition about. Old Allie's baseball
mitt. I happened to have it with me, in my suitcase, so I got it out and copied down the
poems that were written on it. All I had to do was change Allie's name so that nobody
would know it was my brother and not Stradlater's. I wasn't too crazy about doing it, but I
couldn't think of anything else descriptive. Besides, I sort of liked writing about it. It took
me about an hour, because I had to use Stradlater's lousy typewriter, and it kept jamming
on me. The reason I didn't use my own was because I'd lent it to a guy down the hall. It was around ten-thirty, I guess, when I finished it. I wasn't tired, though, so I
looked out the window for a while. It wasn't snowing out any more, but every once in a
while you could hear a car somewhere not being able to get started. You could also hear
old Ackley snoring. Right through the goddam shower curtains you could hear him. He
had sinus trouble and he couldn't breathe too hot when he was asleep. That guy had just
about everything. Sinus trouble, pimples, lousy teeth, halitosis, crumby fingernails. You
had to feel a little sorry for the crazy sonuvabitch. 6
 Some things are hard to remember. I'm thinking now of when Stradlater got back
from his date with Jane. I mean I can't remember exactly what I was doing when I heard
his goddam stupid footsteps coming down the corridor. I probably was still looking out
the window, but I swear I can't remember. I was so damn worried, that's why. When I
really worry about something, I don't just fool around. I even have to go to the bathroom
when I worry about something. Only, I don't go. I'm too worried to go. I don't want to
interrupt my worrying to go. If you knew Stradlater, you'd have been worried, too. I'd
double-dated with that bastard a couple of times, and I know what I'm talking about. He
was unscrupulous. He really was. Anyway, the corridor was all linoleum and all, and you could hear his goddam
footsteps coming right towards the room. I don't even remember where I was sitting when
he came in--at the window, or in my chair or his. I swear I can't remember. He came in griping about how cold it was out. Then he said, "Where the hell is
everybody? It's like a goddam morgue around here." I didn't even bother to answer him. If he was so goddam stupid not to realize it was Saturday night and everybody was out or
asleep or home for the week end, I wasn't going to break my neck telling him. He started
getting undressed. He didn't say one goddam word about Jane. Not one. Neither did I. I
just watched him. All he did was thank me for letting him wear my hound's-tooth. He
hung it up on a hanger and put it in the closet. Then when he was taking off his tie, he asked me if I'd written his goddam
composition for him. I told him it was over on his goddam bed. He walked over and read
it while he was unbuttoning his shirt. He stood there, reading it, and sort of stroking his
bare chest and stomach, with this very stupid expression on his face. He was always
stroking his stomach or his chest. He was mad about himself. All of a sudden, he said, "For Chrissake, Holden. This is about a goddam baseball
glove."
 "So what?" I said. Cold as hell. "Wuddaya mean so what? I told ya it had to be about a goddam room or a house
or something."
 "You said it had to be descriptive. What the hell's the difference if it's about a
baseball glove?"
 "God damn it." He was sore as hell. He was really furious. "You always do
everything backasswards." He looked at me. "No wonder you're flunking the hell out of
here," he said. "You don't do one damn thing the way you're supposed to. I mean it. Not
one damn thing."
 "All right, give it back to me, then," I said. I went over and pulled it right out of
his goddam hand. Then I tore it up. "What the hellja do that for?" he said. I didn't even answer him. I just threw the pieces in the wastebasket. Then I lay
down on my bed, and we both didn't say anything for a long time. He got all undressed,
down to his shorts, and I lay on my bed and lit a cigarette. You weren't allowed to smoke
in the dorm, but you could do it late at night when everybody was asleep or out and
nobody could smell the smoke. Besides, I did it to annoy Stradlater.

Style and Tone Analysis:
Here are the practical, actionable guidelines for the translator, focusing on consistent and context-aware tone and speaking style for the provided text segment:

### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is informal, highly conversational, and deeply personal, reflecting Holden Caulfield's direct, cynical, yet occasionally vulnerable perspective. It's a stream-of-consciousness style, characterized by a teenage voice that is world-weary, prone to hyperbole, and uses frequent colloquialisms. The overall tone should be very much **구어체 (colloquial style)**, akin to someone speaking directly to you, and it should consistently employ **반말 (informal, non-honorific language)**, even for general descriptive passages, to maintain Holden's distinctive voice.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **First-person, Stream-of-Consciousness:** Preserve the subjective viewpoint. The narration should feel like Holden's unfiltered thoughts and observations.
    *   **Colloquialisms/Slang:** Accurately translate expressions like "goddam," "stupid," "moron," "sonuvabitch," "the hell," "pretty hard." Aim for Korean equivalents that convey similar levels of informal frustration, dismissal, or emphasis without sounding overly harsh or anachronistic. For "goddam," consider variations like "젠장," "빌어먹을," "지랄 같은," or "망할." For "moron," "얼간이," "멍청이," "바보." For "sonuvabitch," "개자식," "개새끼."
    *   **Repetition:** Maintain the repetitive nature of certain words (e.g., "goddam," "moron") to reflect Holden's fixations and emotional state.
    *   **Hyperbole:** Convey the exaggerated nature of Holden's descriptions (e.g., "practically yelling," "mad as hell," "never saw such gore").
    *   **Internal Monologue/Self-reflection:** Ensure Holden's self-reflections, judgments, and asides come across clearly with the same informal, often cynical, and sometimes self-deprecating tone.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden**
    *   **Speaking to:** Stradlater, Ackley
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Highly emotional, angry, and defiant when confronting Stradlater. Later, he is more casual, slightly annoyed, but also seeking distraction and connection when speaking to Ackley. His underlying cynicism and vulnerability should always be present.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Consistently use **해라체 (Haera-che) / 반말 (Banmal)**.
        *   **To Stradlater:** When angry and defiant ("Why should I?", "go wash his own moron face", "give Mrs. Schmidt the time"), use strong, confrontational **해라체** expressions, potentially incorporating appropriate Korean expletives or highly dismissive terms.
        *   **To Ackley:** Maintain **해라체**, but with a slightly less aggressive, more conversational, and sometimes persistent tone ("Y'awake?", "What the hellya doing?", "Wanna play Canasta?"). His attempts to downplay his injury ("It'll stop.") should also be in this informal, dismissive **해라체**.

*   **Character: Stradlater**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Initially angry, threatening, and attempting to assert dominance. After hitting Holden, he becomes nervous and worried about the injury, but still expresses frustration and blames Holden. He tries to maintain an authoritative stance.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Primarily **해라체 (Haera-che) / 반말 (Banmal)**, but with an aggressive and commanding undertone.
        *   **Angry/Threatening:** Use blunt, strong **해라체** commands and warnings ("I'm warning you, now. For the last time. If you don't keep your yap shut..."), employing direct, impactful Korean equivalents for "God damn it" (e.g., "젠장," "제기랄").
        *   **Nervous/Worried but still Frustrated:** While the tone might shift to convey nervousness ("sounded pretty nervous," "looked worried"), the speech level remains **해라체**. His questions and accusations ("Why the hell don'tcha shut up?", "You asked for it, God damn it") should still convey his frustration and desire for control. His command to "Go wash your face" should be a firm **해라체** instruction.

*   **Character: Ackley**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Starts sleepy and annoyed by the noise. Transitions to annoyance, complaining, but also curiosity and eventually genuine concern for Holden's injury. His dialogue is generally informal and somewhat whiny or grumbling.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Consistently use **해라체 (Haera-che) / 반말 (Banmal)**.
        *   **Sleepy/Annoyed:** Use clipped, slightly grumbling **해라체** phrases ("Yeah.", "Wuddaya mean what the hell am I doing?", "Wuddaya want the light for?").
        *   **Complaining/Disbelieving:** Express his frustration and disbelief through exasperated **해라체** ("What the hell was the fight about, anyhow?", "Canasta, for Chrissake. Do you know what time it is?").
        *   **Concerned:** When expressing concern for Holden's injury ("Jesus! What the hell happened to you?", "You're still bleeding, for Chrissake. You better put something on it."), the **해라체** should convey genuine worry, perhaps with a slightly less harsh tone compared to Stradlater's anger.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
It drove him crazy
when you broke any rules. He never smoked in the dorm. It was only me. He still didn't say one single solitary word about Jane. So finally I said, "You're
back pretty goddam late if she only signed out for nine-thirty. Did you make her be late
signing in?"
 He was sitting on the edge of his bed, cutting his goddam toenails, when I asked
him that. "Coupla minutes," he said. "Who the hell signs out for nine-thirty on a Saturday
night?" God, how I hated him. "Did you go to New York?" I said. "Ya crazy? How the hell could we go to New York if she only signed out for
nine-thirty?"
 "That's tough."
 He looked up at me. "Listen," he said, "if you're gonna smoke in the room, how
'bout going down to the can and do it? You may be getting the hell out of here, but I have
to stick around long enough to graduate."
 I ignored him. I really did. I went right on smoking like a madman. All I did was
sort of turn over on my side and watched him cut his damn toenails. What a school. You
were always watching somebody cut their damn toenails or squeeze their pimples or
something. "Did you give her my regards?" I asked him. "Yeah."
 The hell he did, the bastard. "What'd she say?" I said. "Did you ask her if she still keeps all her kings in the
back row?"
 "No, I didn't ask her. What the hell ya think we did all night--play checkers, for
Chrissake?"
 I didn't even answer him. God, how I hated him. "If you didn't go to New York, where'd ya go with her?" I asked him, after a little
while. I could hardly keep my voice from shaking all over the place. Boy, was I getting
nervous. I just had a feeling something had gone funny. He was finished cutting his damn toenails. So he got up from the bed, in just his
damn shorts and all, and started getting very damn playful. He came over to my bed and
started leaning over me and taking these playful as hell socks at my shoulder. "Cut it
out," I said. "Where'd you go with her if you didn't go to New York?"
 "Nowhere. We just sat in the goddam car." He gave me another one of those
playtul stupid little socks on the shoulder. "Cut it out," I said. "Whose car?"
 "Ed Banky's."
 Ed Banky was the basketball coach at Pencey. Old Stradlater was one of his pets,
because he was the center on the team, and Ed Banky always let him borrow his car when
he wanted it. It wasn't allowed for students to borrow faculty guys' cars, but all the
athletic bastards stuck together. In every school I've gone to, all the athletic bastards stick
together. Stradlater kept taking these shadow punches down at my shoulder. He had his
toothbrush in his hand, and he put it in his mouth. "What'd you do?" I said. "Give her the
time in Ed Banky's goddam car?" My voice was shaking something awful. "What a thing to say. Want me to wash your mouth out with soap?"
 "Did you?"
 "That's a professional secret, buddy."
 This next part I don't remember so hot. All I know is I got up from the bed, like I
was going down to the can or something, and then I tried to sock him, with all my might,
right smack in the toothbrush, so it would split his goddam throat open. Only, I missed. I
didn't connect. All I did was sort of get him on the side of the head or something. It
probably hurt him a little bit, but not as much as I wanted. It probably would've hurt him
a lot, but I did it with my right hand, and I can't make a good fist with that hand. On
account of that injury I told you about. Anyway, the next thing I knew, I was on the goddam floor and he was sitting on
my chest, with his face all red. That is, he had his goddam knees on my chest, and he
weighed about a ton. He had hold of my wrists, too, so I couldn't take another sock at
him. I'd've killed him. "What the hell's the matter with you?" he kept saying, and his stupid race kept
getting redder and redder. "Get your lousy knees off my chest," I told him. I was almost bawling. I really
was. "Go on, get off a me, ya crumby bastard."
 He wouldn't do it, though. He kept holding onto my wrists and I kept calling him
a sonuvabitch and all, for around ten hours. I can hardly even remember what all I said to
him. I told him he thought he could give the time to anybody he felt like. I told him he
didn't even care if a girl kept all her kings in the back row or not, and the reason he didn't
care was because he was a goddam stupid moron. He hated it when you called a moron. All morons hate it when you call them a moron. "Shut up, now, Holden," he said with his big stupid red face. "just shut up, now."
 "You don't even know if her first name is Jane or Jean, ya goddam moron!"
 "Now, shut up, Holden, God damn it--I'm warning ya," he said--I really had him
going. "If you don't shut up, I'm gonna slam ya one."
 "Get your dirty stinking moron knees off my chest."
 "If I letcha up, will you keep your mouth shut?"
 I didn't even answer him. He said it over again. "Holden. If I letcha up, willya keep your mouth shut?"
 "Yes."
 He got up off me, and I got up, too. My chest hurt like hell from his dirty knees. "You're a dirty stupid sonuvabitch of a moron," I told him.

Style and Tone Analysis:
As a Korean translation director, my goal is to ensure the translation captures the unique voice and tone of "The Catcher in the Rye," particularly Holden Caulfield's cynical, jaded, and deeply personal perspective. Consistency in speech levels and careful nuance in dialogue are paramount.

### 1. Narration Style

*   **Overall Tone:** The narration should primarily adopt an informal, colloquial, and highly subjective **문어체 (mun-eo-che)**, leaning heavily towards a conversational style. It must convey a sense of immediacy, cynicism, and jadedness, characteristic of Holden's inner world. The tone is often world-weary, prone to exaggeration, and frequently sarcastic or ironic, yet also punctuated by moments of profound loneliness and despair. Maintain a stream-of-consciousness feel, reflecting Holden's unedited thoughts and emotions.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Internal Monologue:** Preserve the consistent flow of Holden's internal thoughts and feelings. These should feel raw, personal, and sometimes depressive, angry, or disgusted. The translator must distinguish between Holden's direct observations and his deeper emotional reflections.
    *   **Colloquialism/Slang:** Translate expletives and slang terms (e.g., "goddam," "crumby," "lousy personality," "fat-assed," "give the time to") to Korean equivalents that convey similar levels of informality and mild vulgarity without sounding overly harsh, anachronistic, or out of character for a cynical American teenager of that era. Avoid overly strong or overly polite expressions where a more casual, slightly rebellious tone is intended.
    *   **Sarcasm/Irony:** This is crucial to Holden's voice. Ensure that sarcastic remarks (e.g., "You're a real prince," "What a witty guy," "He was the perfect host") are clearly identifiable as such through subtle word choice, sentence structure, and implied tone, even if the literal meaning is positive.
    *   **Exaggeration:** Maintain Holden's tendency to exaggerate for emotional emphasis (e.g., "drop dead," "fiftieth time," "jump out the window").
    *   **Repetition:** Preserve instances of repetition for emphasis (e.g., "Damn near. Damn near.") to convey Holden's obsessive or ruminative thoughts.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden (Narrator/Speaker)**
    *   **Speaking to: Ackley**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** Ranges from sarcastic and mocking ("You're a real prince," "fascinating life"), to desperate/pleading ("cigarettes"), blunt and annoyed ("About you," "This room stinks," "Don'tcha ever send them to the laundry?"), defensive/evasive ("I may. I may not. Don't worry about it."), to reassuring but with a sarcastic undertone ("Relax. I'm not gonna sleep here. I wouldn't abuse your goddam hospitality."), and finally, vulnerable and lonely (whispering "Hey, Ackley").
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Predominantly use **해라체 (Haera-che)** and **해체 (Hae-che)** to convey the informal, peer-to-peer relationship between two male students.
            *   For sarcastic or mocking lines, use **해체 (Hae-che)** or **하게체 (Hage-che)** with appropriate nuance to convey a condescending or teasing tone (e.g., using terms like '군자님' or '학자님' with a playful or ironic informal ending).
            *   For blunt complaints or annoyed questions, use direct **해체 (Hae-che)** or **해라체 (Haera-che)**, possibly incorporating informal interjections.
            *   For the desperate cigarette request, maintain the informal tone but add a slightly pleading nuance that comes across as a casual, almost off-hand request.
            *   When Holden is lying or dismissing Ackley, the **해체 (Hae-che)** should sound dismissive or evasive.
            *   The whispered "Hey, Ackley" should still be informal, but convey a sense of fragility or quiet desperation, perhaps by softening the typical bluntness of **해체 (Hae-che)**.
    *   **Speaking to: Self (Internal Monologue/Narration)**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** Deeply personal, reflective, often expressing lonesomeness, despair, anger, disgust, or cynical observation. He is processing his thoughts and feelings about the world around him, Jane, Stradlater, and himself. These are unedited, raw thoughts.
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Exclusively use **해라체 (Haera-che)** or **해체 (Hae-che)**. These levels are ideal for internal narration and conveying a direct, unmediated stream of consciousness. Ensure that the translation captures the raw emotion, the slang, and the occasional abruptness of Holden's thoughts without sounding overly formal or stiff. For descriptive passages or observations, **해라체 (Haera-che)** is fitting. For intensely emotional or abrupt thoughts, **해체 (Hae-che)** can be more impactful. Maintain the distinct "Holden-isms" even in his private thoughts.

*   **Character: Ackley**
    *   **Speaking to: Holden**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** Often defensive ("No, I mean it--"), curious and persistent ("what the hell was the fight about?"), surprised/disbelieving ("About me, for Chrissake?"), excited/flattered ("He did? No kidding?"), defensive/slightly aggressive ("If you don't like it, you know what you can do"), impatient/demanding ("turn off the goddam light"), and nosy/prudish ("What're ya gonna do--sleep in Ely's bed?," "I'd hate like hell if Ely came in...").
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Primarily use **해라체 (Haera-che)** and **해체 (Hae-che)**, reflecting his informal relationship with Holden and his slightly unsophisticated, often socially awkward demeanor.
            *   For his defensive or persistent questions, use a direct **해라체 (Haera-che)**, emphasizing his slightly bothersome nature.
            *   His exclamations of surprise or excitement should use **해체 (Hae-che)**, conveying a certain naive eagerness.
            *   His demanding or slightly aggressive lines should also be in **해라체 (Haera-che)** or **해체 (Hae-che)**, conveying his annoyance or impatience, possibly with a slightly whiny tone.
            *   His nosy and prudish comments should similarly be in an informal style, perhaps with a slightly nagging or self-righteous nuance.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
That got him really mad. He shook his big stupid finger in my face. "Holden, God
damn it, I'm warning you, now. For the last time. If you don't keep your yap shut, I'm
gonna--"
 "Why should I?" I said--I was practically yelling. "That's just the trouble with all
you morons. You never want to discuss anything. That's the way you can always tell a
moron. They never want to discuss anything intellig--"
 Then he really let one go at me, and the next thing I knew I was on the goddam
floor again. I don't remember if he knocked me out or not, but I don't think so. It's pretty
hard to knock a guy out, except in the goddam movies. But my nose was bleeding all
over the place. When I looked up old Stradlater was standing practically right on top of
me. He had his goddam toilet kit under his arm. "Why the hell don'tcha shut up when I
tellya to?" he said. He sounded pretty nervous. He probably was scared he'd fractured my
skull or something when I hit the floor. It's too bad I didn't. "You asked for it, God damn
it," he said. Boy, did he look worried. I didn't even bother to get up. I just lay there in the floor for a while, and kept
calling him a moron sonuvabitch. I was so mad, I was practically bawling. "Listen. Go wash your face," Stradlater said. "Ya hear me?"
 I told him to go wash his own moron face--which was a pretty childish thing to
say, but I was mad as hell. I told him to stop off on the way to the can and give Mrs. Schmidt the time. Mrs. Schmidt was the janitor's wife. She was around sixty-five. I kept sitting there on the floor till I heard old Stradlater close the door and go
down the corridor to the can. Then I got up. I couldn't find my goddam hunting hat
anywhere. Finally I found it. It was under the bed. I put it on, and turned the old peak
around to the back, the way I liked it, and then I went over and took a look at my stupid
face in the mirror. You never saw such gore in your life. I had blood all over my mouth
and chin and even on my pajamas and bath robe. It partly scared me and it partly
fascinated me. All that blood and all sort of made me look tough. I'd only been in about
two fights in my life, and I lost both of them. I'm not too tough. I'm a pacifist, if you want
to know the truth. I had a feeling old Ackley'd probably heard all the racket and was awake. So I
went through the shower curtains into his room, just to see what the hell he was doing. I
hardly ever went over to his room. It always had a funny stink in it, because he was so
crumby in his personal habits. 7
 A tiny bit of light came through the shower curtains and all from our room, and I
could see him lying in bed. I knew damn well he was wide awake. "Ackley?" I said. "Y'awake?"
 "Yeah."
 It was pretty dark, and I stepped on somebody's shoe on the floor and danm near
fell on my head. Ackley sort of sat up in bed and leaned on his arm. He had a lot of white
stuff on his face, for his pimples. He looked sort of spooky in the dark. "What the hellya
doing, anyway?" I said. "Wuddaya mean what the hell am I doing? I was tryna sleep before you guys
started making all that noise. What the hell was the fight about, anyhow?"
 "Where's the light?" I couldn't find the light. I was sliding my hand all over the
wall. "Wuddaya want the light for? . . . Right next to your hand."
 I finally found the switch and turned It on. Old Ackley put his hand up so the light
wouldn't hurt his eyes. "Jesus!" he said. "What the hell happened to you?" He meant all the blood and all. "I had a little goddam tiff with Stradlater," I said. Then I sat down on the floor. They never had any chairs in their room. I don't know what the hell they did with their
chairs. "Listen," I said, "do you feel like playing a little Canasta?" He was a Canasta
fiend. "You're still bleeding, for Chrissake. You better put something on it."
 "It'll stop. Listen. Ya wanna play a little Canasta or don'tcha?"
 "Canasta, for Chrissake. Do you know what time it is, by any chance?"
 "It isn't late. It's only around eleven, eleven-thirty."
 "Only around!" Ackley said. "Listen. I gotta get up and go to Mass in the
morning, for Chrissake. You guys start hollering and fighting in the middle of the
goddam--What the hell was the fight about, anyhow?"
 "It's a long story. I don't wanna bore ya, Ackley. I'm thinking of your welfare," I
told him. I never discussed my personal life with him. In the first place, he was even
more stupid than Stradlater. Stradlater was a goddam genius next to Ackley. "Hey," I
said, "is it okay if I sleep in Ely's bed tonight? He won't be back till tomorrow night, will
he?" I knew damn well he wouldn't. Ely went home damn near every week end. "I don't know when the hell he's coming back," Ackley said. Boy, did that annoy me. "What the hell do you mean you don't know when he's
coming back? He never comes back till Sunday night, does he?"
 "No, but for Chrissake, I can't just tell somebody they can sleep in his goddam
bed if they want to."
 That killed me. I reached up from where I was sitting on the floor and patted him
on the goddam shoulder. "You're a prince, Ackley kid," I said.

Style and Tone Analysis:
Here are the practical, actionable guidelines for translating the provided text segment, focusing on maintaining the unique voice and tone.

### 1. Narration Style

*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is characterized by Holden Caulfield's highly informal, colloquial (구어체), and conversational voice. It should feel like a direct, unfiltered stream of consciousness from a cynical, introspective, and somewhat melancholic teenager. The language is simple, direct, and often repetitive, reflecting a youthful, rambling thought process rather than a polished literary style. The translator must prioritize natural, everyday Korean expressions over formal or overly literary ones.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Internal Monologue:** The entire narration serves as Holden's internal monologue. This must be preserved, conveying his raw thoughts and feelings directly to the reader. Use **해라체 (Haera-che)** predominantly for the narration to capture this informal, declarative, and personal voice.
    *   **Colloquialisms & Slang:** The text is replete with informal expressions ("goddam," "aces," "wise guy," "get the hell out," "loaded," "dough," "marbles"). Seek out natural, contemporary Korean equivalents that convey the same level of informality and rebellious youthfulness without sounding overly dated or forced. For "goddam," consider expressions like "젠장," "빌어먹을," or "아주 그냥."
    *   **Repetition & Intensifiers:** Holden frequently uses repetition ("very, very quiet") and intensifiers ("pretty sad," "quite a few," "very rapid packer"). Translate these to convey emphasis naturally in Korean (e.g., "정말이지," "꽤," "몹시").
    *   **Sarcasm & Cynicism:** A pervasive element of Holden's voice. Even when expressing appreciation or sadness, there's often an underlying layer of sarcasm or cynicism. This nuanced tone must be carefully maintained through word choice and sentence structure.
    *   **Exaggeration:** Holden often exaggerates situations or his feelings ("a million dopy questions," "damn near broke my crazy neck"). Convey this hyperbolic tendency in Korean without making it sound unnatural.
    *   **Vulnerability & Melancholy:** Despite the cynicism, Holden's underlying sadness, loneliness, and vulnerability are key. The translation should allow these emotions to surface authentically amidst his typical register.

    *   **Speaking to:** Ackley, Frederick Woodruff, and implicitly, the students of Pencey (in his final yell).
    *   **Context/Emotion:**
        *   **To Ackley ("You're aces, Ackley kid," "You know that?"):** A mix of genuine appreciation and his characteristic sarcastic, slightly condescending affection. He's being sincere in a Holden-esque way.
        *   **To Frederick Woodruff (implied, asking for money):** Pragmatic, slightly manipulative, but still within the bounds of peer interaction.
        *   **To the students (yelling, "Sleep tight, ya morons!"):** A powerful outburst of anger, defiance, and profound sadness, serving as his rebellious farewell.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   For all direct dialogue with peers (Ackley, Woodruff), use **해체 (Hae-che)**. This is the most appropriate informal style for peers in everyday conversation. Ensure the tone aligns with the specific emotion:
            *   **To Ackley:** Use a friendly but slightly jaded **해체** to convey the mixed emotions. For "You're aces, Ackley kid," consider phrases like "야, 너 진짜 최고다, 애클리 자식아" or "너 정말 멋진 놈이야, 애클리 녀석."
            *   **To Woodruff:** A straightforward **해체** for the transactional nature of the conversation.
            *   **Final Yell:** A very strong, almost aggressive **해체** or **해라체 (Haera-che)** for emphasis and dramatic impact, using exclamatory particles. For "Sleep tight, ya morons!", options like "잘 처자라, 이 얼간이들아!" or "다들 잘 자라, 이 바보들아!" would work.

*   **Character: Ackley**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden Caulfield
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Annoyed, gruff, and slightly aggressive, characteristic of his personality and typical teenage banter. He's just been woken up and is reacting to Holden's remarks.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use **해체 (Hae-che)**. His tone should be surly and direct. For "Wise guy. Someday somebody's gonna bash your--", consider "건방진 자식. 언젠가 누가 네 놈의 대갈통을 깨버릴 줄 알아" or "까부는 소리 하네. 언젠가 누가 네 주둥이를 확..."

*   **Character: Frederick Woodruff**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden Caulfield (dialogue is narrated by Holden)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Annoyed at being woken up, hesitant, and reluctant to buy the typewriter.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Although his dialogue is indirectly reported, the translator should imply his speech was in **해체 (Hae-che)**, fitting for a peer. Holden's narration of Woodruff's response should convey this informality and his annoyance.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
"You know that?"
 "No, I mean it--I can't just tell somebody they can sleep in--"
 "You're a real prince. You're a gentleman and a scholar, kid," I said. He really
was, too. "Do you happen to have any cigarettes, by any chance?--Say 'no' or I'll drop
dead."
 "No, I don't, as a matter of fact. Listen, what the hell was the fight about?"
 I didn't answer him. All I did was, I got up and went over and looked out the
window. I felt so lonesome, all of a sudden. I almost wished I was dead. "What the hell was the fight about, anyhow?" Ackley said, for about the fiftieth
time. He certainly was a bore about that. "About you," I said. "About me, for Chrissake?"
 "Yeah. I was defending your goddam honor. Stradlater said you had a lousy
personality. I couldn't let him get away with that stuff."
 That got him excited. "He did? No kidding? He did?"
 I told him I was only kidding, and then I went over and laid down on Ely's bed. Boy, did I feel rotten. I felt so damn lonesome. "This room stinks," I said. "I can smell your socks from way over here. Don'tcha
ever send them to the laundry?"
 "If you don't like it, you know what you can do," Ackley said. What a witty guy. "How 'bout turning off the goddam light?"
 I didn't turn it off right away, though. I just kept laying there on Ely's bed,
thinking about Jane and all. It just drove me stark staring mad when I thought about her
and Stradlater parked somewhere in that fat-assed Ed Banky's car. Every time I thought
about it, I felt like jumping out the window. The thing is, you didn't know Stradlater. I
knew him. Most guys at Pencey just talked about having sexual intercourse with girls all
the time--like Ackley, for instance--but old Stradlater really did it. I was personally
acquainted with at least two girls he gave the time to. That's the truth. "Tell me the story of your fascinating life, Ackley kid," I said. "How 'bout turning off the goddam light? I gotta get up for Mass in the morning."
 I got up and turned it off, if it made him happy. Then I laid down on Ely's bed
again. "What're ya gonna do--sleep in Ely's bed?" Ackley said. He was the perfect host,
boy. "I may. I may not. Don't worry about it."
 "I'm not worried about it. Only, I'd hate like hell if Ely came in all of a sudden and
found some guy--"
 "Relax. I'm not gonna sleep here. I wouldn't abuse your goddam hospitality."
 A couple of minutes later, he was snoring like mad. I kept laying there in the dark
anyway, though, trying not to think about old Jane and Stradlater in that goddam Ed
Banky's car. But it was almost impossible. The trouble was, I knew that guy Stradlater's
technique. That made it even worse. We once double-dated, in Ed Banky's car, and
Stradlater was in the back, with his date, and I was in the front with mine. What a
technique that guy had. What he'd do was, he'd start snowing his date in this very quiet,
sincere voice--like as if he wasn't only a very handsome guy but a nice, sincere guy, too. I
damn near puked, listening to him. His date kept saying, "No--please. Please, don't. Please." But old Stradlater kept snowing her in this Abraham Lincoln, sincere voice, and
finally there'd be this terrific silence in the back of the car. It was really embarrassing. I
don't think he gave that girl the time that night--but damn near. Damn near. While I was laying there trying not to think, I heard old Stradlater come back
from the can and go in our room. You could hear him putting away his crumby toilet
articles and all, and opening the window. He was a fresh-air fiend. Then, a little while
later, he turned off the light. He didn't even look around to see where I was at. It was even depressing out in the street. You couldn't even hear any cars any
more. I got feeling so lonesome and rotten, I even felt like waking Ackley up. "Hey, Ackley," I said, in sort of a whisper, so Stradlater couldn't hear me through
the shower curtain. Ackley didn't hear me, though. "Hey, Ackley!"
 He still didn't hear me. He slept like a rock. "Hey, Ackley!"
 He heard that, all right. "What the hell's the matter with you?" he said. "I was asleep, for Chrissake."
 "Listen. What's the routine on joining a monastery?" I asked him. I was sort of
toying with the idea of joining one. "Do you have to be a Catholic and all?"
 "Certainly you have to be a Catholic. You bastard, did you wake me just to ask
me a dumb ques--"
 "Aah, go back to sleep. I'm not gonna join one anyway. The kind of luck I have,
I'd probably join one with all the wrong kind of monks in it. All stupid bastards. Or just
bastards."
 When I said that, old Ackley sat way the hell up in bed. "Listen," he said, "I don't
care what you say about me or anything, but if you start making cracks about my goddam
religion, for Chrissake--"
 "Relax," I said. "Nobody's making any cracks about your goddam religion." I got
up off Ely's bed, and started towards the door. I didn't want to hang around in that stupid
atmosphere any more. I stopped on the way, though, and picked up Ackley's hand, and
gave him a big, phony handshake. He pulled it away from me. "What's the idea?" he said.

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
"아니, 진짜라니까?"
"아니, 그러니까, 아무한테나 막 자기 전에 자라고 할 수는 없다고."
"정말 대단한 군자님이셔. 넌 학식 있는 신사 중의 신사시라니까, 애클리 꼬마." 내가 말했다. 그러고 보니 정말 그랬다. "혹시 담배 좀 있냐? 어? 없다고 말해, 안 그러면 나 정말 죽어버릴 거야."
"아니, 실은 없어. 야, 대체 싸움이 뭐 때문이었어?"
나는 대답하지 않았다. 그저 일어나 창밖을 내다봤을 뿐이었다. 갑자기 너무 외로워서 죽고 싶을 지경이었다.
"대체 싸움이 뭐 때문이었냐고?" 애클리가 한 오십 번쯤은 되는 듯이 말했다. 그 녀석은 그 문제에 대해서는 정말 지겨울 정도로 집요했다.
"너 때문이었어." 내가 말했다.
"나 때문이라고, 젠장?"
"응. 네 빌어먹을 명예를 지키려던 거였지. 스트래드레이터가 네 성격이 빌어먹을 정도라고 했거든. 그런 말은 그냥 넘길 수 없었어."
그 말에 애클리는 신이 났다. "정말? 농담 아니지? 정말 그랬어?"
나는 농담이었다고 말해주고는 엘리의 침대로 가서 누웠다. 아, 정말 기분이 더러웠다. 너무나 빌어먹을 정도로 외로웠다.
"이 방 냄새 지독해." 내가 말했다. "저 멀리서도 네 양말 냄새가 나. 세탁소에 안 보내냐?"
"마음에 안 들면, 알아서 해." 애클리가 말했다. 정말 재치 있는 놈 같으니라고.
"빌어먹을 불 좀 꺼주지 그래?"
하지만 나는 당장 불을 끄지 않았다. 그저 엘리의 침대에 계속 누워 제인과 이것저것 생각하고 있었다. 그녀와 스트래드레이터가 그 뚱뚱한 에드 뱅키의 차 안 어딘가에 주차해 있다는 생각을 하면 그저 미쳐버릴 것 같았다. 그 생각만 하면 창문 밖으로 뛰어내리고 싶었다.
문제는, 너희는 스트래드레이터를 몰랐다는 점이다. 나는 그 녀석을 알았다. 펜시의 대부분 녀석들은 애클리처럼 여자애들과 성관계를 가졌다고 늘 떠들어댈 뿐이었지만, 그 스트래드레이터는 정말로 그랬다. 그 녀석이 잠자리를 같이한 여자애들을 최소 두 명은 내가 직접 알고 있었다. 정말이다.
"네 흥미진진한 삶의 이야기를 들려줘 봐, 애클리 꼬마." 내가 말했다.
"빌어먹을 불 좀 꺼주지 그래? 아침에 미사 가려면 일어나야 한단 말이야."
그 녀석이 만족한다면야, 나는 일어나서 불을 껐다. 그러고는 다시 엘리의 침대에 누웠다.
"뭐 할 건데? 엘리 침대에서 잘 거야?" 애클리가 말했다. 정말이지 완벽한 주인장 같으니라고.
"잘 수도 있고. 안 잘 수도 있고. 걱정 마."
"걱정 안 해. 다만, 엘리가 갑자기 들어와서 어떤 놈이 누워 있는 걸 발견하면 빌어먹을 정도로 싫을 것 같아서 그래."
"진정해. 여기서 안 잘 거야. 네 빌어먹을 환대를 남용하진 않을 테니."
몇 분 뒤, 그 녀석은 미친 듯이 코를 골았다. 나는 그래도 계속 어둠 속에 누워, 빌어먹을 에드 뱅키의 차 안에서 그 옛날 제인과 스트래드레이터에 대해 생각하지 않으려 애썼다. 하지만 거의 불가능했다. 문제는, 나는 그 스트래드레이터 녀석의 수법을 알고 있었다는 것이다. 그것이 상황을 더 나쁘게 만들었다. 우리는 한 번 에드 뱅키의 차로 더블 데이트를 한 적이 있었다. 스트래드레이터는 뒤에 자기 파트너와 있었고, 나는 앞에 내 파트너와 있었다. 그 녀석의 수법이란 정말. 그 녀석은 아주 조용하고 진심 어린 목소리로 자기 파트너를 홀리기 시작하곤 했다. 마치 자신이 잘생겼을 뿐만 아니라 착하고 진실한 녀석인 양 말이다. 나는 그 녀석 말을 들으면서 빌어먹을 정도로 구역질이 날 뻔했다. 그의 파트너는 계속 "안 돼—제발. 제발, 그러지 마. 제발."이라고 말했다. 하지만 그 스트래드레이터는 에이브러햄 링컨처럼 진심 어린 목소리로 그녀를 계속 홀렸고, 마침내 차 뒤편에는 엄청난 침묵이 흘렀다. 정말 창피한 일이었다. 그날 밤 그 녀석이 그 여자애와 잠자리를 같이했다고는 생각지 않지만—빌어먹을, 거의 그랬을 것이다. 거의 그랬을 것이다.
나는 거기 누워 생각하지 않으려 애쓰는 동안, 그 스트래드레이터가 화장실에서 돌아와 우리 방으로 들어가는 소리를 들었다. 그 녀석이 자기의 지저분한 세면도구를 정리하고 창문을 여는 소리가 들렸다. 그 녀석은 신선한 공기 중독자였다. 그러고 나서 잠시 후, 그 녀석은 불을 껐다. 내가 어디 있는지 돌아보지도 않았다.
심지어 거리조차 우울하게 느껴졌다. 더 이상 차 소리도 들리지 않았다. 나는 너무나 외롭고 기분이 더러워서, 애클리를 깨우고 싶다는 생각마저 들었다.
"야, 애클리." 나는 스트래드레이터가 샤워 커튼 너머로 내 소리를 듣지 못하도록 속삭이듯이 말했다. 하지만 애클리는 듣지 못했다. "야, 애클리!"
그 녀석은 여전히 듣지 못했다. 돌처럼 잠들어 있었다. "야, 애클리!"
그 말은 들렸다, 분명히. "대체 뭐야, 너?" 그 녀석이 말했다. "젠장, 자고 있었다고."
"야. 수도원에 들어가는 건 어떻게 하는 거야?" 내가 그 녀석에게 물었다. 나는 뭔가 수도원에 들어갈까 하는 생각을 막연히 하고 있었다. "가톨릭 신자여야 하고 그런 거냐?"
"당연히 가톨릭 신자여야지. 이 자식, 겨우 그런 멍청한 질문 하려고 날 깨운 거야—"
"아, 다시 잠이나 자. 어차피 난 안 들어갈 거야. 내 운이 어떤데, 아마 거기 들어가면 죄다 글러먹은 수도승들이나 있을걸. 다 멍청한 자식들이나. 아니면 그냥 자식들이거나."
내가 그렇게 말하자, 그 애클리 녀석은 침대에서 벌떡 일어났다. "야," 그 녀석이 말했다. "나에 대해 뭘 어떻게 말하든 상관 안 해, 하지만 내 빌어먹을 종교에 대해 함부로 지껄이기 시작하면, 젠장—"
"진정해." 내가 말했다. "아무도 네 빌어먹을 종교에 대해 함부로 말하는 사람 없어." 나는 엘리의 침대에서 일어나 문 쪽으로 향했다. 더 이상 그 빌어먹을 분위기 속에 머물고 싶지 않았다. 그런데 가던 길에 멈춰 서서 애클리의 손을 잡고는 거창하게 가짜 악수를 건넸다. 그 녀석은 내 손을 뿌리쳤다. "무슨 짓이야?" 그 녀석이 말했다.

Style and Tone Analysis:
Here are the guidelines for translating the provided text segment, focusing on maintaining the distinct voice and tone of the original.

### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** 이 지문의 서술은 화자(주인공 홀든 콜필드)의 매우 개인적이고, 내면적이며, 비판적이고, 냉소적인 시각을 담고 있습니다. 비표준적인 구어체 문어이며, 솔직하고 거침없는 독백에 가깝습니다. 세상의 '위선'(phony)에 대한 염세주의와 짜증이 전반적으로 깔려 있으며, 약간의 과장과 우스꽝스러움이 섞여 있습니다. 독자에게 직접 말을 거는 듯한 친밀하고도 불만에 찬 어조를 유지해야 합니다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **내적 독백 (Internal Monologue):** 화자의 생각과 감정이 여과 없이 드러나는 부분은 가장 핵심적인 특징입니다. 이는 주로 비표준적인 **해체 (hae-che)** 또는 거친 **해라체 (hae-ra-che)**를 사용하여 화자의 즉흥적이고 솔직한 감정을 표현해야 합니다.
    *   **구어체 및 비속어/속어 (Colloquialisms & Slang/Mild Expletives):** "phony", "goddam", "lousy", "bastard", "kill me", "crumby" 등 화자의 어휘 선택은 그의 성격과 세계관을 보여줍니다. 한국어 번역에서도 이에 상응하는 비속어나 속어, 혹은 비표준적인 표현(예: "젠장할", "빌어먹을", "엿 같은", "죽인다", "미치겠다", "개자식")을 사용하여 원문의 거칠고 비관적인 분위기를 살려야 합니다. 단, 지나치게 저속하게 들리지 않도록 수위를 조절해야 합니다.
    *   **아이러니 및 풍자 (Irony & Sarcasm):** 화자는 상황이나 인물에 대해 비꼬거나 풍자적인 언급을 자주 합니다. 예를 들어, 어니스트 모로우를 "sensitive"하다고 묘사하는 부분 등에서 드러납니다. 이러한 아이러니는 문맥과 어조를 통해 명확히 전달되어야 합니다.
    *   **과장법 (Hyperbole):** 감정이나 상황을 극적으로 표현하기 위한 과장된 표현이 자주 사용됩니다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Narrator (Holden Caulfield)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Self (internal monologue) / Mrs. Morrow (the lady on the train)
    *   **Context/Emotion:**
        *   **Self (internal monologue):** 세상과 사람들에 대한 불만, 냉소, 피로감, 솔직한 생각. 매우 개인적이고 비공식적인 어조.
        *   **Mrs. Morrow:** 겉으로는 예의를 지키려 노력하지만, 내심으로는 그녀의 '위선'이나 상황에 대한 짜증, 귀찮음, 관찰자적 시선을 유지합니다. 가짜 이름("Rudolf Schmidt")을 대고, 펜시 학교나 아들 어니스트에 대해 거짓말을 하는 등 일종의 가면을 쓴 듯한 태도를 보입니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   **내적 독백 (Internal Monologue) 및 서술:** 화자의 거칠고 솔직하며 비판적인 어조를 살리기 위해 **해라체 (hae-ra-che)**나 **해체 (hae-che)**를 주로 사용합니다. 문어체보다는 구어체적 특성을 강하게 드러내며, 문장 끝맺음이 다소 투박하거나 불완전하게 느껴지도록 번역할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, "...남자들 이름은 데이비드고... 여자들은 린다나 마샤인데, 꼭 그 망할 데이비드들 파이프에 불이나 붙여주고 말이야." 와 같이 비표준적인 연결이나 문장 구성을 활용하여 원문의 흐름을 살립니다. "Women kill me. They really do."와 같은 부분은 "여자들 때문에 미치겠다니까. 진짜 그래."처럼 강한 구어체 감탄사나 표현을 활용합니다.
        *   **Mrs. Morrow에게 말할 때:** 겉으로는 예의를 차리는 모습을 보여주어야 하므로, 기본적으로 **해요체 (hae-yo-che)**를 사용합니다. 그러나 그의 내면의 짜증이나 무관심이 은연중에 드러나도록, 지나치게 공손하거나 친절한 톤보다는 다소 무미건조하거나 형식적인 **해요체 (hae-yo-che)**를 유지합니다. 특히 거짓말을 하거나 '헛소리(shooting the old crap)'를 하는 부분에서는 다소 과장되게 예의를 갖추는 느낌을 주어 그의 위선적인 면모를 표현할 수 있습니다. "Yes, it is," "Yes, I do," "Rudolf Schmidt" 등 짧은 대답은 담담한 **해요체 (hae-yo-che)**로, "Pencey? It's not too bad. It's not paradise or anything, but it's as good as most schools." 같은 부분은 약간의 무관심이 묻어나는 **해요체 (hae-yo-che)**로 번역합니다. "We can smoke till they start screaming at us"와 같은 대사는 **해요체 (hae-yo-che)**이지만, 약간의 반항적이거나 무심한 뉘앙스를 담아냅니다.

*   **Character: Mrs. Morrow (Ernest Morrow's mother)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Narrator (Holden Caulfield)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 아들에 대한 자부심과 약간의 걱정, 그리고 화자에 대한 호기심과 친절함을 표현합니다. 전형적인 상류층 부인의 예의 바르고 다소 순진한 (혹은 위선적인) 모습을 보여줍니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 시종일관 예의 바르고 상냥한 **해요체 (hae-yo-che)**를 사용합니다. "Oh, how lovely!", "Oh, how nice!", "May I ask your name, dear?" 등은 매우 부드럽고 친절한 뉘앙스를 담아 번역해야 합니다. "Rudolf"라고 화자의 가짜 이름을 부르는 부분은 그녀의 친근함(혹은 약간의 무례함)을 보여주지만, 역시 상냥한 **해요체 (hae-yo-che)**로 유지합니다. "I don't believe this is a smoker, Rudolf,"는 예의 바르면서도 규칙을 지키려는 그녀의 태도를 보여주는 부드러운 **해요체 (hae-yo-che)**로 번역합니다.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
"No idea. I just want to thank you for being such a goddam prince, that's all," I
said. I said it in this very sincere voice. "You're aces, Ackley kid," I said. "You know
that?"
 "Wise guy. Someday somebody's gonna bash your--"
 I didn't even bother to listen to him. I shut the damn door and went out in the
corridor. Everybody was asleep or out or home for the week end, and it was very, very
quiet and depressing in the corridor. There was this empty box of Kolynos toothpaste
outside Leahy and Hoffman's door, and while I walked down towards the stairs, I kept
giving it a boot with this sheep-lined slipper I had on. What I thought I'd do, I thought I
might go down and see what old Mal Brossard was doing. But all of a sudden, I changed
my mind. All of a sudden, I decided what I'd really do, I'd get the hell out of Pencey--
right that same night and all. I mean not wait till Wednesday or anything. I just didn't
want to hang around any more. It made me too sad and lonesome. So what I decided to
do, I decided I'd take a room in a hotel in New York--some very inexpensive hotel and
all--and just take it easy till Wednesday. Then, on Wednesday, I'd go home all rested up
and feeling swell. I figured my parents probably wouldn't get old Thurmer's letter saying
I'd been given the ax till maybe Tuesday or Wednesday. I didn't want to go home or
anything till they got it and thoroughly digested it and all. I didn't want to be around
when they first got it. My mother gets very hysterical. She's not too bad after she gets
something thoroughly digested, though. Besides, I sort of needed a little vacation. My
nerves were shot. They really were. Anyway, that's what I decided I'd do. So I went back to the room and turned on
the light, to start packing and all. I already had quite a few things packed. Old Stradlater
didn't even wake up. I lit a cigarette and got all dressed and then I packed these two
Gladstones I have. It only took me about two minutes. I'm a very rapid packer. One thing about packing depressed me a little. I had to pack these brand-new ice
skates my mother had practically just sent me a couple of days before. That depressed
me. I could see my mother going in Spaulding's and asking the salesman a million dopy
questions--and here I was getting the ax again. It made me feel pretty sad. She bought me
the wrong kind of skates--I wanted racing skates and she bought hockey--but it made me
sad anyway. Almost every time somebody gives me a present, it ends up making me sad. After I got all packed, I sort of counted my dough. I don't remember exactly how
much I had, but I was pretty loaded. My grandmother'd just sent me a wad about a week
before. I have this grandmother that's quite lavish with her dough. She doesn't have all
her marbles any more--she's old as hell--and she keeps sending me money for my
birthday about four times a year. Anyway, even though I was pretty loaded, I figured I
could always use a few extra bucks. You never know. So what I did was, I went down the
hail and woke up Frederick Woodruff, this guy I'd lent my typewriter to. I asked him how
much he'd give me for it. He was a pretty wealthy guy. He said he didn't know. He said
he didn't much want to buy it. Finally he bought it, though. It cost about ninety bucks,
and all he bought it for was twenty. He was sore because I'd woke him up. When I was all set to go, when I had my bags and all, I stood for a while next to
the stairs and took a last look down the goddam corridor. I was sort of crying. I don't
know why. I put my red hunting hat on, and turned the peak around to the back, the way I
liked it, and then I yelled at the top of my goddam voice, "Sleep tight, ya morons!" I'll bet
I woke up every bastard on the whole floor. Then I got the hell out. Some stupid guy had
thrown peanut shells all over the stairs, and I damn near broke my crazy neck. 8
 It was too late to call up for a cab or anything, so I walked the whole way to the
station. It wasn't too far, but it was cold as hell, and the snow made it hard for walking,
and my Gladstones kept banging hell out of my legs. I sort of enjoyed the air and all,
though. The only trouble was, the cold made my nose hurt, and right under my upper lip,
where old Stradlater'd laid one on me. He'd smacked my lip right on my teeth, and it was
pretty sore. My ears were nice and warm, though. That hat I bought had earlaps in it, and
I put them on--I didn't give a damn how I looked. Nobody was around anyway. Everybody was in the sack. I was quite lucky when I got to the station, because I only had to wait about ten
minutes for a train. While I waited, I got some snow in my hand and washed my face
with it. I still had quite a bit of blood on. Usually I like riding on trains, especially at night, with the lights on and the
windows so black, and one of those guys coming up the aisle selling coffee and
sandwiches and magazines. I usually buy a ham sandwich and about four magazines. If
I'm on a train at night, I can usually even read one of those dumb stories in a magazine
without puking. You know.

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
몰라. 그냥 네가 빌어먹을 정도로 대단한 군자인 데 대해 고맙다고 말하고 싶었을 뿐이야. 나는 아주 진심 어린 목소리로 그렇게 말했다. "야, 너 정말 멋진 놈이야, 애클리 녀석아." 내가 말했다. "알고 있냐?"
"까부는 소리 하네. 언젠가 누가 네 놈의 대갈통을 깨버릴 줄 알아—"
나는 그 녀석 말은 들을 가치도 없었다. 나는 빌어먹을 문을 닫고 복도로 나갔다. 모두 잠들었거나 밖에 나갔거나 주말이라 집에 가고 없었고, 복도는 아주, 아주 조용하고 우울했다. 리히와 호프만 방 문 앞에는 텅 빈 콜리노스 치약 상자가 놓여 있었는데, 내가 계단 쪽으로 걸어가면서 신고 있던 양털 안감 슬리퍼로 그걸 계속 걷어찼다. 나는 무얼 할까 생각하다가, 말 브로사드 녀석은 뭘 하고 있을지 내려가 볼까 싶었다. 그런데 문득 마음을 바꿨다. 갑자기 내가 진짜로 할 일은 펜시에서 빌어먹을 듯이 떠나버리는 거라고 결정했다—바로 그날 밤에 말이다. 수요일까지 기다리거나 할 것도 없이 말이다. 더 이상 머물고 싶지 않았다. 너무나 슬프고 외로웠기 때문이다. 그래서 내가 하기로 결정한 것은 뉴욕의 호텔에 방을 잡는 것이었다—아주 저렴한 호텔 같은 곳에 말이다—그리고 수요일까지 그냥 편히 지내기로 했다. 그러고 나서 수요일에 푹 쉬고 기분 좋게 집에 갈 참이었다. 부모님은 내가 퇴학당했다는 소식의 써머 편지를 아마도 화요일이나 수요일까지는 받지 못할 거라고 나는 생각했다. 나는 부모님이 그 편지를 받고 그 내용을 충분히 소화할 때까지는 집에 가거나 하고 싶지 않았다. 부모님이 처음 그 편지를 받을 때 나는 그 자리에 있고 싶지 않았다. 우리 엄마는 아주 히스테리를 부리시거든. 하지만 뭘 충분히 소화하시고 나면 그렇게 심하시지는 않는다. 게다가 나는 좀 휴식이 필요했다. 신경이 다 망가져 있었다. 정말 그랬다.
어쨌든, 나는 그렇게 하기로 결정했다. 그래서 나는 방으로 돌아가 불을 켜고 짐을 싸기 시작했다. 나는 이미 꽤 많은 짐을 싸둔 상태였다. 스트래드레이터 녀석은 깨지도 않았다. 나는 담배에 불을 붙이고 옷을 다 입은 다음, 내가 가진 그 글래드스톤 가방 두 개를 쌌다. 겨우 이 분 정도밖에 걸리지 않았다. 나는 짐을 아주 빨리 싸는 편이다.
짐을 싸는 것 중에 한 가지가 나를 좀 우울하게 만들었다. 우리 엄마가 거의 며칠 전에 막 보내주신 새 스케이트를 싸야 했다. 그게 나를 우울하게 만들었다. 엄마가 스폴딩 백화점에 가서 판매원에게 수백만 가지의 얼빠진 질문을 하는 모습이 눈에 선한데, 나는 또다시 퇴학당하는 신세였다. 꽤 슬픈 기분이 들었다. 엄마는 내게 엉뚱한 종류의 스케이트를 사주셨다—나는 경주용 스케이트를 원했는데 하키용을 사주셨다—하지만 어쨌든 나를 슬프게 만들었다. 누가 내게 선물을 줄 때마다 거의 늘 결국 나를 슬프게 만든다.
짐을 다 싼 다음, 나는 가지고 있던 돈을 대충 세어봤다. 정확히 얼마가 있었는지는 기억나지 않지만, 꽤 넉넉했다. 할머니가 일주일쯤 전에 뭉칫돈을 막 보내주셨거든. 우리 할머니는 돈을 아주 후하게 쓰시는 분이다. 할머니는 이제 제정신이 아니시다—빌어먹을 정도로 늙으셨다—그래서 일 년에 네 번쯤 내 생일이라고 돈을 계속 보내주신다. 어쨌든, 꽤 돈이 많았지만, 나는 몇 푼 더 있으면 언제든 요긴하게 쓸 수 있을 거라고 생각했다. 혹시 모르니까 말이다. 그래서 나는 복도로 내려가 내 타자기를 빌려줬던 프레더릭 우드러프 녀석을 깨웠다. 그 녀석에게 얼마에 사겠느냐고 물었다. 그 녀석은 꽤 부자였다. 그 녀석은 모르겠다고 말했다. 별로 사고 싶지 않다고 했다. 결국 그 녀석은 사긴 샀지만. 구십 달러쯤 하는 거였는데 겨우 이십 달러에 샀다. 내가 자기를 깨웠다고 심통이 나 있었다.
모든 준비를 마치고 짐까지 다 챙겼을 때, 나는 계단 옆에 잠시 서서 빌어먹을 복도를 마지막으로 한번 내려다봤다. 나는 약간 울고 있었다. 왜인지는 몰랐다. 나는 빨간 사냥 모자를 쓰고, 내가 좋아하는 방식으로 챙을 뒤로 돌려썼다. 그러고 나서 빌어먹을 목청껏 소리 질렀다. "잘 처자라, 이 얼간이들아!" 아마 그 층의 모든 빌어먹을 놈들을 다 깨웠을 거다. 그러고 나서 나는 빌어먹을 듯이 떠났다. 어떤 멍청한 놈이 계단 전체에 땅콩 껍질을 던져놨는데, 나는 빌어먹을 목이 부러질 뻔했다.
택시를 부르거나 할 시간은 너무 늦어서, 나는 역까지 내내 걸어갔다. 그리 멀지는 않았지만 빌어먹을 정도로 추웠고, 눈 때문에 걷기가 힘들었고, 내 글래드스톤 가방은 내 다리를 빌어먹을 듯이 때려댔다. 그래도 나는 공기가 좋고 뭐 그런 건 좀 즐겼다. 단 한 가지 문제는, 추위 때문에 코가 아팠고, 스트래드레이터 녀석이 한 방 먹인 윗입술 바로 아래도 아팠다는 점이었다. 그 녀석이 내 입술을 이빨에 바로 부딪치게 때렸는데, 꽤 쓰라렸다. 그래도 내 귀는 아주 따뜻했다. 내가 산 그 모자에는 귀마개가 달려 있어서 나는 그걸 썼다—내가 어떻게 보이든 빌어먹을 만큼 신경 쓰지 않았다. 어차피 아무도 없었다. 모두 잠자리에 들어 있었다.
역에 도착했을 때 나는 꽤 운이 좋았다. 기차를 겨우 십 분 정도밖에 기다리지 않아도 되었기 때문이다. 기다리는 동안 나는 손에 눈을 받아 그걸로 얼굴을 씻었다. 얼굴에 피가 아직 꽤 묻어 있었다. 나는 보통 기차 타는 것을 좋아한다. 특히 밤에 불이 켜지고 창문이 새까만 채로, 통로를 오가며 커피와 샌드위치, 잡지를 파는 사람들이 있을 때 말이다. 나는 보통 햄 샌드위치 하나와 잡지 네 권쯤을 산다. 밤에 기차 안에 있으면, 잡지에 실린 그런 멍청한 이야기 중 하나쯤은 구역질하지 않고도 읽을 수 있다. 알잖아.

### Static Rules Used:
Global Style: Translate the narration in a formal, literary style (문어체). Avoid overly academic or stiff expressions. The tone should be immersive and engaging for a novel reader.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is highly informal, colloquial, and subjective, resembling a stream of consciousness. It's told from the first-person perspective of a cynical, jaded, yet sometimes vulnerable teenager (Holden Caulfield) directly addressing the reader. The tone is conversational (구어체), often sarcastic, and features frequent interjections and repetitions, conveying a sense of spontaneity and an unfiltered internal monologue.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **직접적인 독자에게의 말걸기 (Direct Address to the Reader):** The narrator frequently speaks directly to "you" (the reader), creating an intimate and confessional atmosphere. This should be preserved using appropriate informal forms in Korean.
    *   **내적 독백 및 자기 수정 (Internal Monologue and Self-Correction):** The narrator's thoughts, judgments, and occasional self-awareness ("boy, was I chucking it") are interspersed throughout.
    *   **속어 및 구어체 표현 (Slang and Colloquialisms):** Abundant use of informal language, idiomatic expressions, and slang that reflects the narrator's age and personality. The translation should strive to find Korean equivalents that convey a similar level of informality and contemporary feel without sounding overly dated or unnatural.
    *   **과장 및 허풍 (Exaggeration and Boasting/Lying):** The narrator often exaggerates or outright lies, a characteristic trait. The tone should reflect this glibness.
    *   **냉소주의 (Cynicism):** A pervasive cynical and judgmental undertone towards adults and "phonies."

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Narrator (Holden Caulfield)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Mrs. Morrow (dialogue), Self/Reader (narration/internal thoughts)
    *   **Context/Emotion:**
        *   **To Mrs. Morrow:** Initially manipulative and performative, attempting to deceive her about her son's character with fabricated stories, while maintaining a casual, almost charming facade. Later, seeking companionship (cocktail offer) and then downplaying a serious illness with glibness and lies. His tone is generally nonchalant, slightly jaded, and confident in his ability to "handle" adults.
        *   **Narration/Internal Thoughts:** Unfiltered, cynical, judgmental, direct, and highly opinionated. Reflects his true, unvarnished personality.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   **When speaking to Mrs. Morrow:** Use a polite but casual **해요체**. While polite, it should subtly convey his underlying detached, slightly mocking, or manipulative attitude. Avoid overly formal or respectful honorifics that would imply genuine deference. The politeness is more a social convention he employs. For instances where he's "chucking crap," the tone should be convincing yet somewhat glib.
        *   **Narration (speaking to the reader/internal monologue):** Primarily use **해라체** and **해체**. This reflects his direct, informal, and personal address to the reader, and his internal thoughts. It should sound like a young person speaking very candidly and casually, using common informal interjections and sentence endings (e.g., '~잖아,' '~말이야,' '~거든,' '~지,' '~잖아').

*   **Character: Mrs. Morrow**
    *   **Speaking to:** Narrator (Holden)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Initially intrigued and receptive to hearing about her son, then politely concerned about Holden's drinking habits. Shows genuine worry and sympathy when Holden reveals his illness, and expresses general kindness and maternal warmth. Her tone is gentle, polite, and caring, without being "snotty."
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Consistently use a gentle and polite **해요체**. Her speech should convey a sense of a kind, respectable, and slightly traditional elder woman. Even when expressing concern or asking questions, her politeness should remain evident. Use appropriate honorifics where natural (e.g., using ~시- for Holden's actions if speaking about them, though she mostly speaks directly to him).

### Immediate Context Used (English):
One of those stories with a lot of phony, lean-jawed guys
named David in it, and a lot of phony girls named Linda or Marcia that are always
lighting all the goddam Davids' pipes for them. I can even read one of those lousy stories
on a train at night, usually. But this time, it was different. I just didn't feel like it. I just
sort of sat and not did anything. All I did was take off my hunting hat and put it in my
pocket. All of a sudden, this lady got on at Trenton and sat down next to me. Practically
the whole car was empty, because it was pretty late and all, but she sat down next to me,
instead of an empty seat, because she had this big bag with her and I was sitting in the
front seat. She stuck the bag right out in the middle of the aisle, where the conductor and
everybody could trip over it. She had these orchids on, like she'd just been to a big party
or something. She was around forty or forty-five, I guess, but she was very good looking. Women kill me. They really do. I don't mean I'm oversexed or anything like that--
although I am quite sexy. I just like them, I mean. They're always leaving their goddam
bags out in the middle of the aisle. Anyway, we were sitting there, and all of a sudden she said to me, "Excuse me,
but isn't that a Pencey Prep sticker?" She was looking up at my suitcases, up on the rack. "Yes, it is," I said. She was right. I did have a goddam Pencey sticker on one of
my Gladstones. Very corny, I'll admit. "Oh, do you go to Pencey?" she said. She had a nice voice. A nice telephone
voice, mostly. She should've carried a goddam telephone around with her. "Yes, I do," I said. "Oh, how lovely! Perhaps you know my son, then, Ernest Morrow? He goes to
Pencey."
 "Yes, I do. He's in my class."
 Her son was doubtless the biggest bastard that ever went to Pencey, in the whole
crumby history of the school. He was always going down the corridor, after he'd had a
shower, snapping his soggy old wet towel at people's asses. That's exactly the kind of a
guy he was. "Oh, how nice!" the lady said. But not corny. She was just nice and all. "I must
tell Ernest we met," she said. "May I ask your name, dear?"
 "Rudolf Schmidt," I told her. I didn't feel like giving her my whole life history. Rudolf Schmidt was the name of the janitor of our dorm. "Do you like Pencey?" she asked me. "Pencey? It's not too bad. It's not paradise or anything, but it's as good as most
schools. Some of the faculty are pretty conscientious."
 "Ernest just adores it."
 "I know he does," I said. Then I started shooting the old crap around a little bit. "He adapts himself very well to things. He really does. I mean he really knows how to
adapt himself."
 "Do you think so?" she asked me. She sounded interested as hell. "Ernest? Sure," I said. Then I watched her take off her gloves. Boy, was she lousy
with rocks. "I just broke a nail, getting out of a cab," she said. She looked up at me and sort of
smiled. She had a terrifically nice smile. She really did. Most people have hardly any
smile at all, or a lousy one. "Ernest's father and I sometimes worry about him," she said. "We sometimes feel he's not a terribly good mixer."
 "How do you mean?"
 "Well. He's a very sensitive boy. He's really never been a terribly good mixer with
other boys. Perhaps he takes things a little more seriously than he should at his age."
 Sensitive. That killed me. That guy Morrow was about as sensitive as a goddam
toilet seat. I gave her a good look. She didn't look like any dope to me. She looked like she
might have a pretty damn good idea what a bastard she was the mother of. But you can't
always tell--with somebody's mother, I mean. Mothers are all slightly insane. The thing
is, though, I liked old Morrow's mother. She was all right. "Would you care for a
cigarette?" I asked her. She looked all around. "I don't believe this is a smoker, Rudolf," she said. Rudolf. That killed me. "That's all right. We can smoke till they start screaming at us," I said. She took a
cigarette off me, and I gave her a light. She looked nice, smoking. She inhaled and all, but she didn't wolf the smoke
down, the way most women around her age do. She had a lot of charm. She had quite a
lot of sex appeal, too, if you really want to know. She was looking at me sort of funny. I may be wrong but I believe your nose is
bleeding, dear, she said, all of a sudden. I nodded and took out my handkerchief. "I got hit with a snowball," I said. "One
of those very icy ones." I probably would've told her what really happened, but it
would've taken too long. I liked her, though. I was beginning to feel sort of sorry I'd told
her my name was Rudolf Schmidt. "Old Ernie," I said. "He's one of the most popular
boys at Pencey. Did you know that?"
 "No, I didn't."
 I nodded. "It really took everybody quite a long time to get to know him. He's a
funny guy. A strange guy, in lots of ways--know what I mean? Like when I first met him. When I first met him, I thought he was kind of a snobbish person. That's what I thought. But he isn't. He's just got this very original personality that takes you a little while to get
to know him."

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** 구어체 (Colloquial/Conversational). 10대 후반 화자의 내적 독백 (Internal Monologue) 비중이 매우 높으며, 시니컬하고 불평이 많으며, 다소 염세적이지만 그 안에 순수함과 외로움이 공존하는 복합적인 어조를 유지해야 합니다. 비격식적이고 즉흥적인 말투 (마치 말을 내뱉듯이 자연스럽게 이어지는 문장 구성)를 살려 화자의 개성을 표현합니다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **내적 독백 (Internal Monologue):** 화자의 생각과 감정이 여과 없이 드러나도록 직접적이고 비격식적인 문체 ('해체' 또는 '반말체')를 활용하여 생생하게 전달합니다. 화자의 혼잣말이나 생각의 흐름을 끊김 없이 반영합니다.
    *   **아이러니/풍자 (Irony/Sarcasm):** "He certainly was good company. Terrific personality."와 같이 겉으로는 긍정적이지만 실제로는 비꼬는 듯한 화자의 어조를 번역에 반영하여 독자가 아이러니를 느낄 수 있도록 합니다.
    *   **과장 (Exaggeration):** "breaking a goddam leg," "one chance in a million" 등 과장된 표현을 통해 화자의 강렬한 감정 상태나 비현실적인 상황 인식을 전달합니다.
    *   **구어체 표현 및 속어 (Colloquialisms & Slang):** "goddam," "screwball," "wise guy," "crumby," "shack up," "loaded" 등 원문의 비격식적이고 때로는 거친 어감을 한국어의 유사한 비속어, 신조어, 또는 구어체 관용구로 적절히 옮겨야 합니다. 과도한 사용은 피하되, 화자의 개성을 살리는 선에서 조절합니다. (예: "goddam"은 '젠장할', '빌어먹을', '지독한' 등으로 문맥에 따라 조절)
    *   **반복 (Repetition):** "Do you happen to know, by any chance? Do you happen to know, by any chance?"와 같은 반복은 화자의 초조함이나 집착을 나타내므로, 한국어에서도 이 뉘앙스를 살려 반복하거나 유사한 의미의 강조 표현을 사용합니다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: 화자 (Holden Caulfield)**
    *   **Speaking to:** 자기 자신 (내적 독백), 택시 기사
    *   **Context/Emotion:**
        *   **내적 독백 시:** 세상에 대한 불만, 냉소, 불안감, 우울감, 권태, 자기 성찰, 회상 등 복합적인 감정의 혼재.
        *   **택시 기사에게 말할 때:**
            *   처음에는 자신의 실수를 알리며 약간의 미안함과 정중함 유지.
            *   오리 질문 시에는 엉뚱하고 순수한 호기심과 함께 약간의 초조함과 간절함.
            *   호텔 관련 대화 시에는 (incognito, loaded 등) 허세와 과장, 그리고 동시에 어딘가 어설프고 어색한 태도. 대화를 이어가고 싶어 하는 내면의 외로움.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   **내적 독백:** 가장 비격식적인 **해체 (반말체)**를 기본으로 사용합니다. 화자의 솔직하고 거침없는 생각의 흐름을 반영해야 합니다. 비속어나 강한 어조의 표현은 화자의 심리 상태와 어울리게 조절합니다.
        *   **택시 기사에게 말할 때:**
            *   초반에는 약간의 정중함을 담은 **해요체** 또는 부드러운 **해라체** (예: "좀 돌려주시겠어요?", "죄송한데 방향 좀 바꿔주실 수 있나요?")를 사용합니다.
            *   오리 질문 시에는 화자의 엉뚱하고 순수한 면을 살려 **해요체**를 사용하되, 반복을 통해 간절함을 표현합니다. (예: "혹시 어디로 가는지 아세요? 혹시 아시나요?")
            *   허세를 부리거나 농담조로 말할 때는 **해요체**를 사용하되, 문맥상 어색함이나 허세가 느껴지도록 어미나 표현을 조절합니다. (예: "저 여행 중이라서요.", "제가 한턱 낼게요. 돈 많아요.")
            *   **주의:** 화자의 나이(16세)를 고려하여 지나치게 성인스러운 존대말('하십시오체')은 피하고, 상황과 감정에 따라 '해요체'와 '해라체'를 유연하게 오가며 화자의 특징을 살립니다.

*   **Character: 택시 기사 (Cab Driver)**
    *   **Speaking to:** 화자 (Holden Caulfield)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 무뚝뚝하고, 시니컬하며, 피곤하고 귀찮아하는 듯한 태도. 직업상 많은 사람을 상대해 본 듯한 노련함과 함께 무례하진 않지만 친절하지도 않은 전형적인 'wise guy' (닳고 닳은 사람, 능글맞은 사람)의 모습.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   **해라체**를 기본으로 사용합니다. 화자에게 존대하지 않고, 간결하고 무뚝뚝하게 응대하는 태도를 반영합니다. "Mac"이나 "bud(dy)"와 같은 호칭은 한국어에서 '손님', '아저씨', 또는 친근감이 없는 '이봐', '자네' 등으로 번역하되, 한국적 맥락에서 택시 기사가 승객에게 사용할 수 있는 무심한 호칭을 찾습니다.
        *   대답은 짧고 건조하며, 때로는 불친절하게 들릴 수 있도록 표현합니다. (예: "여기서 못 돌려. 일방통행이야.", "뭐 하자는 거야, 임마?", "모르겠는데.", "안 돼, 미안.")
        *   화자의 엉뚱한 질문에 대한 반응 ("What're ya tryna do, bud? Kid me?")은 비웃거나 무시하는 듯한 뉘앙스를 **해라체**로 표현합니다.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
Morrow didn't say anything, but boy, you should've seen her. I had her
glued to her seat. You take somebody's mother, all they want to hear about is what a hotshot their son is. Then I really started chucking the old crap around. "Did he tell you about the
elections?" I asked her. "The class elections?"
 She shook her head. I had her in a trance, like. I really did. "Well, a bunch of us wanted old Ernie to be president of the class. I mean he was
the unanimous choice. I mean he was the only boy that could really handle the job," I
said--boy, was I chucking it. "But this other boy--Harry Fencer--was elected. And the
reason he was elected, the simple and obvious reason, was because Ernie wouldn't let us
nominate him. Because he's so darn shy and modest and all. He refused. . . Boy, he's
really shy. You oughta make him try to get over that." I looked at her. "Didn't he tell you
about it?"
 "No, he didn't."
 I nodded. "That's Ernie. He wouldn't. That's the one fault with him--he's too shy
and modest. You really oughta get him to try to relax occasionally."
 Right that minute, the conductor came around for old Mrs. Morrow's ticket, and it
gave me a chance to quit shooting it. I'm glad I shot it for a while, though. You take a guy
like Morrow that's always snapping their towel at people's asses--really trying to hurt
somebody with it--they don't just stay a rat while they're a kid. They stay a rat their whole
life. But I'll bet, after all the crap I shot, Mrs. Morrow'll keep thinking of him now as this
very shy, modest guy that wouldn't let us nominate him for president. She might. You
can't tell. Mothers aren't too sharp about that stuff. "Would you care for a cocktail?" I asked her. I was feeling in the mood for one
myself. "We can go in the club car. All right?"
 "Dear, are you allowed to order drinks?" she asked me. Not snotty, though. She
was too charming and all to be snotty. "Well, no, not exactly, but I can usually get them on account of my heighth," I
said. "And I have quite a bit of gray hair." I turned sideways and showed her my gray
hair. It fascinated hell out of her. "C'mon, join me, why don't you?" I said. I'd've enjoyed
having her. "I really don't think I'd better. Thank you so much, though, dear," she said. "Anyway, the club car's most likely closed. It's quite late, you know." She was right. I'd
forgotten all about what time it was. Then she looked at me and asked me what I was afraid she was going to ask me. "Ernest wrote that he'd be home on Wednesday, that Christmas vacation would start on
Wednesday," she said. "I hope you weren't called home suddenly because of illness in the
family." She really looked worried about it. She wasn't just being nosy, you could tell. "No, everybody's fine at home," I said. "It's me. I have to have this operation."
 "Oh! I'm so sorry," she said. She really was, too. I was right away sorry I'd said it,
but it was too late. "It isn't very serious. I have this tiny little tumor on the brain."
 "Oh, no!" She put her hand up to her mouth and all. "Oh, I'll be all right and
everything! It's right near the outside. And it's a very tiny one. They can take it out in
about two minutes."
 Then I started reading this timetable I had in my pocket. Just to stop lying. Once I
get started, I can go on for hours if I feel like it. No kidding. Hours. We didn't talk too much after that. She started reading this Vogue she had with
her, and I looked out the window for a while. She got off at Newark. She wished me a lot
of luck with the operation and all. She kept calling me Rudolf. Then she invited me to
visit Ernie during the summer, at Gloucester, Massachusetts. She said their house was
right on the beach, and they had a tennis court and all, but I just thanked her and told her I
was going to South America with my grandmother. Which was really a hot one, because
my grandmother hardly ever even goes out of the house, except maybe to go to a goddam
matinee or something. But I wouldn't visit that sonuvabitch Morrow for all the dough in
the world, even if I was desperate. 9
 The first thing I did when I got off at Penn Station, I went into this phone booth. I
felt like giving somebody a buzz. I left my bags right outside the booth so that I could
watch them, but as soon as I was inside, I couldn't think of anybody to call up. My
brother D.B. was in Hollywood. My kid sister Phoebe goes to bed around nine o'clock--
so I couldn't call her up. She wouldn't've cared if I'd woke her up, but the trouble was, she
wouldn't've been the one that answered the phone. My parents would be the ones. So that
was out. Then I thought of giving Jane Gallagher's mother a buzz, and find out when
Jane's vacation started, but I didn't feel like it. Besides, it was pretty late to call up. Then I
thought of calling this girl I used to go around with quite frequently, Sally Hayes,
because I knew her Christmas vacation had started already--she'd written me this long,
phony letter, inviting me over to help her trim the Christmas tree Christmas Eve and all--
but I was afraid her mother'd answer the phone.

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
모로우 아주머니는 아무 말도 안 했지만, 야, 아주머니 표정을 봤어야 했다. 아주머니는 내 말에 완전히 정신이 팔린 것 같았다. 남의 엄마들 데려다 놓고 보면 말이야, 다들 자기 아들이 얼마나 대단한 녀석인지 듣고 싶어 한다니까. 그러고 나서 나는 본격적으로 허튼소리를 지껄이기 시작했다. "어니스트가 선거 이야기 안 했어요?" 나는 아주머니에게 물었다. "반장 선거 말이에요."
아주머니는 고개를 저었다. 나는 아주머니를 거의 홀려놓은 거나 다름없었다. 진짜 그랬다니까. "글쎄요, 저희 중 여럿이 어니를 반장으로 만들고 싶어 했거든요. 제 말은, 모두가 만장일치로 원했다는 말이에요. 정말 그 일을 제대로 해낼 수 있는 유일한 친구였다니까요." 나는 말했다. 아, 내가 또 얼마나 헛소리를 지껄여댔는지. "근데 다른 친구, 해리 펜서가 당선됐어요. 그 친구가 뽑힌 이유는, 정말 간단하고 뻔한 이유인데, 어니가 저희가 자기를 추천하는 걸 허락하지 않았기 때문이에요. 너무나 수줍어하고 겸손해서 말이죠. 거절했다니까요... 아, 정말 수줍음이 많아요. 아주머니께서 어니가 그런 점을 극복하도록 도와주셔야 할 것 같아요." 나는 아주머니를 바라봤다. "어니스트가 아주머니께는 말씀 안 드렸어요?"
"네, 안 그랬어요."
나는 고개를 끄덕였다. "그게 어니예요. 절대 말 안 할걸요. 걔한테 딱 한 가지 단점이 있다면, 너무 수줍고 겸손하다는 거예요. 아주머니께서 어니한테 가끔 좀 긴장을 풀라고 시키셔야 할 거예요."
바로 그때, 차장이 모로우 아주머니의 표를 확인하러 왔다. 덕분에 나는 지껄이던 헛소리를 멈출 수 있었다. 그래도 한동안 그렇게 지껄여댄 게 나쁘지 않았다. 어니스트처럼 샤워하고 나오면 맨날 사람들 엉덩이에 젖은 수건을 휘두르며—진짜 사람을 아프게 하려고—괴롭히는 녀석들은 어려서만 그런 쥐새끼 같은 짓을 하는 게 아니다. 평생을 그렇게 산다. 하지만 내가 지껄인 모든 헛소리 덕분에, 모로우 아주머니는 이제 어니스트를 반장으로 추천하는 것조차 거부할 정도로 너무나 수줍고 겸손한 친구라고 계속 생각할 게 분명했다. 그럴지도 모른다. 누가 알겠는가. 엄마들은 그런 일에는 그리 똑똑하지 못하니까. "칵테일 한 잔 하실래요?" 나는 아주머니에게 물었다. 나도 한 잔 하고 싶은 기분이었다. "클럽 칸으로 갈 수 있는데, 어떠세요?"
"얘, 너 술 주문해도 되는 나이니?" 아주머니가 물었다. 하지만 퉁명스럽지 않았다. 아주머니는 너무나 매력적이어서 퉁명스러울 수가 없었다. "음, 정확히 말하면 아니지만, 저는 키 때문에 보통 주문할 수 있어요." 내가 말했다. "그리고 흰머리도 꽤 많거든요." 나는 옆으로 돌아서서 흰머리를 보여줬다. 아주머니는 거기에 완전히 홀린 듯했다. "이리 와서 같이 한 잔 해요, 어때요?" 내가 말했다. 아주머니랑 같이 마시면 좋았을 텐데.
"아무래도 안 하는 게 좋겠어요. 그래도 정말 고마워요, 얘." 아주머니가 말했다. "아무튼, 클럽 칸은 아마 문 닫았을 거예요. 꽤 늦었잖아요." 아주머니 말이 맞았다. 나는 시간이 몇 시인지 완전히 잊고 있었다. 그러고 나서 아주머니는 나를 보며 내가 물어볼까 봐 두려워했던 것을 물었다. "어니스트가 수요일에 집에 온다고, 크리스마스 방학이 수요일부터 시작된다고 편지에 썼어요." 아주머니가 말했다. "혹시 가족 중에 누가 아파서 급히 집으로 불려온 건 아니길 바라요." 아주머니는 정말 걱정하는 표정이었다. 그냥 남의 일에 참견하는 게 아니라는 걸 알 수 있었다. "아뇨, 집은 다 괜찮아요." 내가 말했다. "저예요. 제가 수술을 받아야 해요."
"아! 정말 미안해요." 아주머니가 말했다. 정말 진심이었다. 나는 곧바로 후회했지만, 이미 늦은 뒤였다. "별로 심각한 건 아니에요. 뇌에 아주 작은 종양이 하나 있어요."
"세상에!" 아주머니는 손으로 입을 가렸다. "아, 괜찮을 거예요, 다 괜찮을 거예요! 아주 바깥쪽에 붙어있고, 아주 작은 거예요. 한 2분이면 빼낼 수 있대요."
그러고 나서 나는 주머니에 있던 시간표를 읽기 시작했다. 거짓말을 그만두기 위해서였다. 한번 시작하면, 마음만 먹으면 몇 시간이고 계속 지껄일 수 있다. 농담이 아니다. 몇 시간이나. 그 후로 우리는 별로 이야기를 하지 않았다. 아주머니는 가지고 있던 보그 잡지를 읽기 시작했고, 나는 한동안 창밖을 내다봤다. 아주머니는 뉴어크에서 내렸다. 수술 잘 되길 바란다며 행운을 빌어줬다. 계속 나를 루돌프라고 불렀다. 그러고 나서 아주머니는 여름에 매사추세츠주 글로스터에 있는 어니네 집에 놀러 오라고 했다. 자기네 집이 해변 바로 앞에 있고 테니스 코트도 있다고 했지만, 나는 그냥 고맙다고 말하고 할머니랑 남아메리카에 갈 거라고 했다. 이건 정말 대단한 거짓말이었는데, 우리 할머니는 빌어먹을 주말 낮 공연 같은 거나 보러 가는 것 말고는 거의 집 밖을 나가지 않기 때문이었다. 하지만 설령 내가 절박하더라도, 세상 모든 돈을 준다 해도 그 개자식 모로우를 방문할 리 만무했다.
펜 스테이션에서 내리자마자 가장 먼저 한 일은 공중전화 부스로 들어가는 것이었다. 누구한테 전화를 걸고 싶었다. 가방들을 부스 바로 밖에 두고 지켜볼 수 있도록 했다. 그런데 막상 부스 안으로 들어가니 전화를 걸 사람이 아무도 생각나지 않았다. 형 D.B.는 할리우드에 있었다. 어린 여동생 피비는 아홉 시쯤 잠자리에 드니 전화할 수 없었다. 내가 깨웠다고 해도 피비는 신경 쓰지 않았겠지만, 문제는 피비가 전화를 받지 않았을 거라는 점이었다. 부모님이 받으실 테고. 그래서 그건 안 됐다. 그러고는 제인 갤러거 엄마한테 전화해서 제인 방학이 언제 시작하는지 알아볼까 생각했지만, 내키지 않았다. 게다가 전화하기에는 꽤 늦은 시간이었다. 그러다 꽤 자주 어울리던 샐리 헤이스라는 여자애한테 전화할까 생각했다. 샐리의 크리스마스 방학이 이미 시작된 걸 알고 있었기 때문인데—그 애는 크리스마스이브에 크리스마스트리 장식을 돕자며 길고 가식적인 편지를 내게 보냈었다—하지만 그 애 엄마가 전화를 받을까 봐 두려웠다.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration maintains an informal, highly personal, and conversational tone, directly reflecting the protagonist's (Holden Caulfield's) stream-of-consciousness. It's characterized by a mix of cynicism, disillusionment, self-deprecation, and a profound sense of alienation, yet also a subtle underlying vulnerability and a search for genuine connection. The voice is that of a jaded teenager grappling with complex emotions and the perceived "phoniness" of the adult world.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Internal Monologue:** The entire narrative functions as an unfiltered window into the narrator's thoughts, opinions, and emotional turmoil. The translation should preserve this direct, unmediated access to his mind.
    *   **Colloquialisms & Slang:** The frequent use of informal and adolescent slang (e.g., "crumby," "horse around," "pain in the ass," "too hot," "dump") is crucial. Translators must find Korean equivalents that convey a similar level of casualness, slight vulgarity, and youthful expression without sounding overly crude or anachronistic.
    *   **Repetition:** Words like "crumby" and "sex" are repeated, emphasizing the narrator's fixations, confusions, and limited vocabulary for expressing complex ideas.
    *   **Self-Contradiction:** The narrator often expresses contradictory thoughts or feelings, highlighting his immaturity, internal conflict, and the struggle to articulate his true sentiments.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Narrator (Holden Caulfield)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Self (internal thoughts and general narration to the implied reader)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Reflective, confused, cynical, frustrated, trying to make sense of the world and his own desires, often self-deprecating and contradictory.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Predominantly use **해라체 (Plain Form)** for the narration and internal monologue. This captures the raw, informal, and direct nature of Holden's thoughts and his jaded, conversational style, as if speaking candidly to himself or an imagined confidant.

*   **Character: Narrator (Holden Caulfield)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Unidentified woman on the phone (Faith Cavendish)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Holden is actively trying to sound "mature," "suave," and sophisticated to disguise his young age and intentions. He's attempting to be persuasive and confident, despite an underlying nervousness ("That sort of scared me a little bit").
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use a polite and somewhat formal **해요체 (Polite Form)**, but one that feels slightly artificial or performative. He is consciously adopting an adult persona. The tone should be deliberate, slightly deeper, and perhaps a bit overly respectful, aiming for a mature and persuasive (albeit manipulative) sound, rather than genuinely polite. Avoid overly casual `해요체`.

*   **Character: Woman's voice (Faith Cavendish / Unidentified)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Narrator (Holden Caulfield), whom she does not know.
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Initially curt and uninviting, quickly becoming annoyed, suspicious, and direct due to the late hour and the unknown caller. Her tone is unwelcoming and accusatory.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   For the initial "Hello?": A neutral **해요체 (Polite Form)**, conveying a lack of warmth or invitation, simply acknowledging the call.
        *   For "Who's this?" and "Who's calling me up at this crazy goddam hour?": A blunt and direct **해라체 (Plain Form)**. This choice emphasizes her annoyance, suspicion, and her lack of interest in being polite with a caller disturbing her at an "insane" hour. It should sound curt, challenging, and slightly aggressive.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
Her mother knew my mother, and I could
picture her breaking a goddam leg to get to the phone and tell my mother I was in New
York. Besides, I wasn't crazy about talking to old Mrs. Hayes on the phone. She once told
Sally I was wild. She said I was wild and that I had no direction in life. Then I thought of
calling up this guy that went to the Whooton School when I was there, Carl Luce, but I
didn't like him much. So I ended up not calling anybody. I came out of the booth, after
about twenty minutes or so, and got my bags and walked over to that tunnel where the
cabs are and got a cab. I'm so damn absent-minded, I gave the driver my regular address, just out of habit
and all--I mean I completely forgot I was going to shack up in a hotel for a couple of days
and not go home till vacation started. I didn't think of it till we were halfway through the
park. Then I said, "Hey, do you mind turning around when you get a chance? I gave you
the wrong address. I want to go back downtown."
 The driver was sort of a wise guy. "I can't turn around here, Mac. This here's a
one-way. I'll have to go all the way to Ninedieth Street now."
 I didn't want to start an argument. "Okay," I said. Then I thought of something, all
of a sudden. "Hey, listen," I said. "You know those ducks in that lagoon right near
Central Park South? That little lake? By any chance, do you happen to know where they
go, the ducks, when it gets all frozen over? Do you happen to know, by any chance?" I
realized it was only one chance in a million. He turned around and looked at me like I was a madman. "What're ya tryna do,
bud?" he said. "Kid me?"
 "No--I was just interested, that's all."
 He didn't say anything more, so I didn't either. Until we came out of the park at
Ninetieth Street. Then he said, "All right, buddy. Where to?"
 "Well, the thing is, I don't want to stay at any hotels on the East Side where I
might run into some acquaintances of mine. I'm traveling incognito," I said. I hate saying
corny things like "traveling incognito." But when I'm with somebody that's corny, I
always act corny too. "Do you happen to know whose band's at the Taft or the New
Yorker, by any chance?"
 "No idear, Mac."
 "Well--take me to the Edmont then," I said. "Would you care to stop on the way
and join me for a cocktail? On me. I'm loaded."
 "Can't do it, Mac. Sorry." He certainly was good company. Terrific personality. We got to the Edmont Hotel, and I checked in. I'd put on my red hunting cap
when I was in the cab, just for the hell of it, but I took it off before I checked in. I didn't
want to look like a screwball or something. Which is really ironic. I didn't know then that
the goddam hotel was full of perverts and morons. Screwballs all over the place. They gave me this very crumby room, with nothing to look out of the window at
except the other side of the hotel. I didn't care much. I was too depressed to care whether
I had a good view or not. The bellboy that showed me to the room was this very old guy
around sixty-five. He was even more depressing than the room was. He was one of those
bald guys that comb all their hair over from the side to cover up the baldness. I'd rather be
bald than do that. Anyway, what a gorgeous job for a guy around sixty-five years old. Carrying people's suitcases and waiting around for a tip. I suppose he wasn't too
intelligent or anything, but it was terrible anyway. After he left, I looked out the window for a while, with my coat on and all. I didn't
have anything else to do. You'd be surprised what was going on on the other side of the
hotel. They didn't even bother to pull their shades down. I saw one guy, a gray-haired,
very distinguished-looking guy with only his shorts on, do something you wouldn't
believe me if I told you. First he put his suitcase on the bed. Then he took out all these
women's clothes, and put them on. Real women's clothes--silk stockings, high-heeled
shoes, brassiere, and one of those corsets with the straps hanging down and all. Then he
put on this very tight black evening dress. I swear to God. Then he started walking up and
down the room, taking these very small steps, the way a woman does, and smoking a
cigarette and looking at himself in the mirror. He was all alone, too. Unless somebody
was in the bathroom--I couldn't see that much. Then, in the window almost right over his,
I saw a man and a woman squirting water out of their mouths at each other. It probably
was highballs, not water, but I couldn't see what they had in their glasses. Anyway, first
he'd take a swallow and squirt it all over her, then she did it to him--they took turns, for
God's sake. You should've seen them. They were in hysterics the whole time, like it was
the funniest thing that ever happened. I'm not kidding, the hotel was lousy with perverts. I
was probably the only normal bastard in the whole place--and that isn't saying much. I
damn near sent a telegram to old Stradlater telling him to take the first train to New York. He'd have been the king of the hotel. The trouble was, that kind of junk is sort of fascinating to watch, even if you don't
want it to be.

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
그 아저씨가 나간 후에, 코트를 입은 채로 한동안 창밖을 내다봤어. 딱히 할 일이 없었거든. 호텔 반대편에서 무슨 일이 벌어지고 있었는지 알면 깜짝 놀랄걸. 그 사람들은 블라인드조차 내릴 생각도 안 하더라. 내가 말하면 안 믿겠지만, 어떤 아저씨를 봤는데, 흰머리에 아주 점잖게 생긴 아저씨가 팬티만 입고 뭘 하더라니까. 먼저 여행 가방을 침대 위에 올려놓더니, 온갖 여자 옷들을 꺼내서 입는 거야. 진짜 여자 옷 말이야—실크 스타킹, 하이힐, 브래지어, 그리고 끈이 주렁주렁 달린 코르셋 같은 거. 그러고는 아주 타이트한 검은색 이브닝 드레스를 입었어. 맹세코 진짜라니까. 그러더니 여자처럼 아주 작은 보폭으로 방을 왔다 갔다 걸으면서 담배를 피우고 거울 속 자기 모습을 쳐다보는 거야. 혼자였어, 그것도. 화장실에 누가 있지 않은 한 말이야—그 정도까지는 안 보였으니까.

그러다 그 아저씨 방 바로 위 창문에서 남자랑 여자가 서로한테 입으로 물을 뿜는 걸 봤어. 아마 물이 아니라 하이볼이었겠지만, 잔에 뭐가 들었는지는 볼 수 없었어. 아무튼, 먼저 남자가 한 모금 마시더니 여자한테 다 뿜고, 그러고는 여자가 남자한테 그랬어—젠장, 번갈아 가면서 하더라니까. 네가 봤어야 했는데. 내내 미친 듯이 웃어댔어, 마치 세상에서 제일 웃긴 일이라도 되는 양 말이야. 농담 아니고, 그 호텔은 변태들로 들끓었어. 아마 내가 그 건물에서 유일하게 정상적인 개자식이었을 거야—그리고 그게 대단한 말도 아니지. 젠장할, 늙은 스트라드레이터한테 뉴욕으로 첫 기차 타고 오라고 전보라도 칠 뻔했어. 그놈이 호텔의 왕이 됐을 텐데. 문제는, 그런 쓰레기 같은 짓거리가 보고 싶지 않아도 왠지 모르게 매혹적이라는 거야.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** 이 소설의 화자인 홀든 콜필드의 시점으로 서술되며, 매우 **주관적이고 사적이며 비형식적인 (subjective, personal, and informal)** 어조를 가집니다. 마치 독자에게 직접 이야기하듯이 **대화체 (conversational style)** 를 유지하며, **청소년 특유의 반항심과 냉소적인 시선 (adolescent rebelliousness and cynical perspective)** 이 묻어납니다. 문어체보다는 **구어체 (colloquial style)** 에 가깝고, 종종 **자기 비하적 (self-deprecating)** 이거나 **직설적이고 솔직한 감정 (direct and honest emotions)** 이 드러납니다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **내면 독백 (Internal Monologue):** 홀든의 생각과 감정이 여과 없이 드러나는 부분은 그의 솔직하고 때로는 미성숙한 심리를 잘 표현하도록 번역해야 합니다. 특히 자신을 자책하거나 후회하는 감정 ("What a dope I was. I shouldn't've said that.")을 그대로 살립니다.
    *   **독자에게 직접 말 거는 듯한 서술 (Direct Address to the Reader):** "You should see her," "You never saw a little kid so pretty..." 등 독자에게 말을 거는 듯한 표현들은 한국어에서도 **친근하고 비공식적인 어투**로 살려야 합니다.
    *   **반복과 과장 (Repetition and Exaggeration):** "suave as hell," "What a dope I was," "Boy, I really fouled that up" 같은 과장된 표현과 반복되는 감탄사나 강조어는 홀든의 감정 상태를 드러내므로 자연스럽게 번역해야 합니다.
    *   **비속어 및 구어체 표현 (Slang and Colloquialisms):** "phony name," "working gal," "shoot the crap" 등 원문의 구어체와 비속어는 한국어에서도 이에 상응하는 **자연스럽고 거침없는 표현**으로 번역하여 홀든의 성격을 살립니다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden Caulfield (홀든 콜필드)**
    *   **Speaking to: Faith Cavendish (페이스 캐번디시) (on the phone)**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** 처음에는 "suave as hell"을 의식하며 **능글맞고 자신감 있는 척 (pretending to be suave and confident)** 하려 하지만, 점차 **조급하고 초조하며 (impatient and anxious)**, **강압적이지 않으면서도 끈질기게 (persistently but not aggressively)** 상대를 설득하려는 모습이 나타납니다. 거절당한 후에는 **자신을 자책하고 후회하는 (self-reproaching and regretful)** 감정이 드러납니다.
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
            *   **상대방(페이스 캐번디시)에게는 해요체 (Haeyo-che)** 를 기본으로 사용하되, **조금 더 친근함이나 능글맞음**을 표현하고자 할 때는 **해체 (Hae-che)** 가 섞일 수 있습니다. (e.g., "What's your name, anyhow, may I ask?" → "이름이 뭐예요, 실례지만?" 또는 "이름이 뭐야, 혹시 물어봐도 돼?")
            *   "suave as hell" 부분에서는 **의도적으로 능글맞은 어투**를 사용하여 홀든의 허세를 표현합니다.
            *   **자신을 비난하는 독백 (internal monologue)이나 독자에게 직접 말하는 서술 (narration)** 에서는 **해라체 (Haera-che)** 또는 **해체 (Hae-che)** 를 사용하여 홀든의 솔직하고 거침없는 성격을 강조합니다. (e.g., "What a dope I was." → "내가 바보였지." 또는 "나 정말 얼간이었어.")

*   **Character: Faith Cavendish (페이스 캐번디시)**
    *   **Speaking to: Holden Caulfield (홀든 콜필드) (on the phone)**
        *   **Context/Emotion:** 처음에는 **정중하지만 단호하게 (polite but firm)** 약속을 거절하며, 자신을 "working gal"로 칭하며 **현실적이고 실용적인 면모 (realistic and practical)** 를 보여줍니다. 홀든의 매력에 약간의 흥미를 느끼는 듯하지만, 결국은 **예의 바르게 선을 긋는 (politely setting boundaries)** 태도를 유지합니다. 그녀의 "English accent"는 **다소 꾸밈이 있거나 세련된 (somewhat affected or sophisticated)** 느낌을 줄 수 있습니다.
        *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
            *   **해요체 (Haeyo-che)** 를 기본으로 사용하며, **정중하고 예의 바른 어조**를 유지합니다.
            *   "I'm not in the habit of making engagements in the middle of the night. I'm a working gal." 같은 부분에서는 **단호하고 현실적인 어조**를 강조합니다.
            *   "You're very sweet," "You sound very attractive" 등 칭찬하는 부분에서는 **부드럽고 상냥한 느낌**을 주되, 여전히 **일정한 거리를 두는 어조**를 유지합니다.
            *   "Well, ordinary, I'd say grand..." 부분에서는 **아쉬움을 표현하는 듯하면서도 분명한 거절 의사**를 담아야 합니다.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
For instance, that girl that was getting water squirted all over her face, she
was pretty good-looking. I mean that's my big trouble. In my mind, I'm probably the
biggest sex maniac you ever saw. Sometimes I can think of very crumby stuff I wouldn't
mind doing if the opportunity came up. I can even see how it might be quite a lot of fun,
in a crumby way, and if you were both sort of drunk and all, to get a girl and squirt water
or something all over each other's face. The thing is, though, I don't like the idea. It
stinks, if you analyze it. I think if you don't really like a girl, you shouldn't horse around
with her at all, and if you do like her, then you're supposed to like her face, and if you
like her face, you ought to be careful about doing crumby stuff to it, like squirting water
all over it. It's really too bad that so much crumby stuff is a lot of fun sometimes. Girls
aren't too much help, either, when you start trying not to get too crumby, when you start
trying not to spoil anything really good. I knew this one girl, a couple of years ago, that
was even crumbier than I was. Boy, was she crumby! We had a lot of fun, though, for a
while, in a crumby way. Sex is something I really don't understand too hot. You never
know where the hell you are. I keep making up these sex rules for myself, and then I
break them right away. Last year I made a rule that I was going to quit horsing around
with girls that, deep down, gave me a pain in the ass. I broke it, though, the same week I
made it--the same night, as a matter of fact. I spent the whole night necking with a
terrible phony named Anne Louise Sherman. Sex is something I just don't understand. I
swear to God I don't. I started toying with the idea, while I kept standing there, of giving old Jane a
buzz--I mean calling her long distance at B.M., where she went, instead of calling up her
mother to find out when she was coming home. You weren't supposed to call students up
late at night, but I had it all figured out. I was going to tell whoever answered the phone
that I was her uncle. I was going to say her aunt had just got killed in a car accident and I
had to speak to her immediately. It would've worked, too. The only reason I didn't do it
was because I wasn't in the mood. If you're not in the mood, you can't do that stuff right. After a while I sat down in a chair and smoked a couple of cigarettes. I was
feeling pretty horny. I have to admit it. Then, all of a sudden, I got this idea. I took out
my wallet and started looking for this address a guy I met at a party last summer, that
went to Princeton, gave me. Finally I found it. It was all a funny color from my wallet,
but you could still read it. It was the address of this girl that wasn't exactly a whore or
anything but that didn't mind doing it once in a while, this Princeton guy told me. He
brought her to a dance at Princeton once, and they nearly kicked him out for bringing her. She used to be a burlesque stripper or something. Anyway, I went over to the phone and
gave her a buzz. Her name was Faith Cavendish, and she lived at the Stanford Arms
Hotel on Sixty-fifth and Broadway. A dump, no doubt. For a while, I didn t think she was home or something. Nobody kept answering. Then, finally, somebody picked up the phone. "Hello?" I said. I made my voice quite deep so that she wouldn't suspect my age
or anything. I have a pretty deep voice anyway. "Hello," this woman's voice said. None too friendly, either. "Is this Miss Faith Cavendish?"
 "Who's this?" she said. "Who's calling me up at this crazy goddam hour?"
 That sort of scared me a little bit. "Well, I know it's quite late," I said, in this very
mature voice and all. "I hope you'll forgive me, but I was very anxious to get in touch
with you." I said it suave as hell. I really did. "Who is this?" she said. "Well, you don't know me, but I'm a friend of Eddie Birdsell's. He suggested that
if I were in town sometime, we ought to get together for a cocktail or two."
 "Who? You're a friend of who?" Boy, she was a real tigress over the phone. She
was damn near yelling at me. "Edmund Birdsell. Eddie Birdsell," I said. I couldn't remember if his name was
Edmund or Edward. I only met him once, at a goddam stupid party. "I don't know anybody by that name, Jack. And if you think I enjoy bein' woke up
in the middle--"
 "Eddie Birdsell? From Princeton?" I said. You could tell she was running the name over in her mind and all. "Birdsell, Birdsell. . . from Princeton.. . Princeton College?"
 "That's right," I said. "You from Princeton College?"
 "Well, approximately."
 "Oh. . . How is Eddie?" she said. "This is certainly a peculiar time to call a person
up, though. Jesus Christ."
 "He's fine. He asked to be remembered to you."
 "Well, thank you. Remember me to him," she said. "He's a grand person. What's
he doing now?" She was getting friendly as hell, all of a sudden. "Oh, you know. Same old stuff," I said. How the hell did I know what he was
doing? I hardly knew the guy. I didn't even know if he was still at Princeton. "Look," I
said. "Would you be interested in meeting me for a cocktail somewhere?"
 "By any chance do you have any idea what time it is?" she said.

"아, 뭐 아시다시피요. 늘 똑같죠, 뭐." 나는 말했다. 내가 젠장 그가 뭘 하는지 어떻게 알겠어? 그 사람 거의 몰랐다. 그가 아직 프린스턴에 있는지조차 몰랐다. "저기요," 나는 말했다. "어디서 칵테일 한잔 하실 의향 있으신가요?"

"혹시 지금이 몇 시쯤 되는지 아세요?" 그녀가 말했다.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** 홀든 콜필드의 내레이션은 매우 비격식적이고(informal), 대화체적이며(conversational), 의식의 흐름(stream-of-consciousness) 기법을 따른다. 전반적으로 냉소적이고(cynical), 비판적이며(critical), 심판하는 듯한(judgmental) 태도를 보인다. 피비와 앨리를 회상할 때는 다소 향수를 느끼는 듯한(nostalgic) 면모도 드러나지만, 기본적으로 반항적이고(rebellious), 비꼬는 듯한(sarcastic) 어조를 유지한다. 비속어와 구어적 표현(slang and colloquialisms)이 매우 풍부하게 사용되며, 그의 개성적인 목소리를 형성하는 핵심 요소이다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **의식의 흐름/내적 독백 (Stream of Consciousness/Internal Monologue):** 홀든의 생각은 여과 없이 솔직하고 두서없이 나열된다. 이는 홀든의 불안정하고 혼란스러운 내면을 보여주는 데 중요하며, 한국어 번역 시에도 홀든의 문체가 아닌, 그의 머릿속을 그대로 옮겨놓은 듯한 날것의 느낌을 살려야 한다.
    *   **구어체 및 비속어 (Colloquialism & Slang):** 홀든의 언어는 비속어, 유행어, 일상적인 대화체가 지배적이다. "That kills me," "I swear to God," "fool around," "pimpy-looking," "whory-looking," "money really talks," "putrid," "corny," "old eye," "fast as hell," "hem and haw," "insulted the hell out of me," "figured the hell with it," "beat it on me," "goddam minor," "strictly from hunger," "give anybody the once-over," "annoyed hell out of me," "given them the freeze" 등과 같은 표현들은 그의 캐릭터를 명확히 드러내므로, 한국어 번역 시에도 이러한 어감을 살릴 수 있는 상응하는 비격식적이고 때로는 거친 표현들을 적극적으로 활용해야 한다. 문어체적 표현은 최대한 피하고, 한국어에서 자연스러운 구어체 문장 구조와 어미를 사용한다.
    *   **과장법 (Hyperbole):** "That kills me," "She killed Allie, too," "She still kills everybody"와 같이 감정을 극단적으로 표현하는 과장된 수사를 자주 사용한다. 한국어에서도 "죽겠어," "죽여줬어" 등과 같이 감탄사처럼 쓰이는 과장된 표현을 활용한다.
    *   **냉소주의 및 비꼼 (Cynicism & Sarcasm):** 인물이나 상황을 묘사할 때 비판적이고 경멸적인 어조를 자주 사용한다(예: "pimpy-looking guys," "whory-looking blondes," "putrid band," "three ugly girls," "giggling like morons"). 어조를 통해 이러한 태도가 드러나도록 표현한다.
    *   **반복 (Repetition):** 특정 구절이나 단어를 반복하여 강조하는 경향이 있다(예: "very tiny little kid," "Can'tcha stick a little rum in it or something?"). 반복의 뉘앙스를 살려 번역한다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Phoebe (어린 시절)**
    *   **Speaking to:** 홀든 또는 앨리 (오빠들)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 어린아이 특유의 호기심과 관심 요구, 직접적이고 단호하면서도 순진한 태도. 대화의 흐름을 방해하려는 의지가 엿보인다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 어린아이임을 감안하여 매우 비격식적이고 친근한 **해체(해)**를 사용하되, 질문의 반복("Who? Who?")에서 오는 재촉하거나 다소 고집스러운 느낌을 살려야 한다. 'lady'는 문맥에 따라 '아줌마' 또는 '여자'로 번역하여 어린아이의 표현을 살린다.
        *   **예시:** "누구? 누가 그랬어? 바비야 아니면 아줌마야?"

*   **Character: 홀든 (내적 독백/생각)**
    *   **Speaking to:** 자기 자신 (과거 회상 및 현재 생각)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 상황에 대한 회상, 판단, 반성, 그리고 좌절감 등. 그의 솔직하고 여과 없는 내면의 소리이다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 내레이션 전체의 기조와 동일하게, 비격식적이고 거침없는 **해라체(해라)**를 일관되게 사용하여 홀든의 내면을 표현한다. 독백이므로, 마치 홀든이 혼잣말을 하는 듯한 느낌을 주어야 한다.
        *   **예시:** "웨이터 코밑에 1달러짜리 지폐나 흔들어줄 걸 그랬지." / "뉴욕에서는 말이야, 돈이 정말 최고거든—농담 아니야." / "걔네한테 아예 쌩깠어야 했는데, 문제는 내가 진짜 춤을 추고 싶었다는 거야."

*   **Character: 웨이터**
    *   **Speaking to:** 홀든 (손님)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 직업적으로 예의 바르고 정중하지만, 규정을 준수하려는 단호한 태도. 다소 주저하거나 미안해하는 뉘앙스도 섞여 있다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 서비스업 종사자가 손님에게 말하는 전형적인 정중하고 격식 있는 **하십시오체(하오)** 또는 정중한 **해요체(요)**를 사용한다. "sir"라는 호칭에 상응하는 공손한 표현을 유지해야 한다. 말끝을 흐리는 부분에서는 "죄송합니다만..."과 같이 꼬리말을 흐려 답답하거나 난처한 감정을 표현한다.
        *   **예시:** "손님, 죄송합니다만, 신분증 같은 거 있으신가요? 혹시 운전면허증이라도요?" / "죄송합니다, 손님, 저희는 규정상..." / "정말 죄송합니다, 손님..."

*   **Character: 홀든**
    *   **Speaking to:** 웨이터
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 처음에는 짜증, 반항심, 상대를 깔보는 듯한 태도. 나중에는 술을 마시고 싶어 하는 절박함 속에서 다소 비굴하거나 달래는 듯한 말투. 전반적으로 웨이터를 자신과 동등하거나 아래로 보는 태도가 깔려있다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   **초기 대화 (도발적이고 무례한 질문):** 웨이터에게 반말 또는 무례하게 들릴 수 있는 **해라체(해라)** 또는 비격식적인 **해요체(요)**를 사용한다. 상대를 위협하거나 깔보는 듯한 어조를 반영한다.
            *   **예시:** "제가 스물한 살 이하로 보입니까?"
        *   **중간 대화 (말 끊기):** 단호하고 무뚝뚝한 **해라체(해라)** 또는 간결한 **해요체(요)**를 사용하여 웨이터의 말을 자른다.
            *   **예시:** "됐어, 됐어." / "콜라 가져다줘."
        *   **후반 대화 (럼을 요구할 때):** "nicely"라고는 하지만, 여전히 웨이터를 자신과 동등하거나 아래로 보는 듯한 비격식적인 **해체(해)** 또는 **해요체(요)**를 사용한다. "Can'tcha"에서 느껴지는 불량스러운 어조와 끈질김을 살리되, 애원하는 듯한 뉘앙스를 추가한다.
            *   **예시:** "거기다 럼 좀 넣어주면 안 돼?" / "이런 촌스러운 데서 맨정신으로 앉아 있을 수가 없어. 럼 좀 넣어주면 안 되냐고?"

### Immediate Context Used (English):
"What's your
name, anyhow, may I ask?" She was getting an English accent, all of a sudden. "You
sound a little on the young side."
 I laughed. "Thank you for the compliment," I said-- suave as hell. "Holden
Caulfield's my name." I should've given her a phony name, but I didn't think of it. "Well, look, Mr. Cawffle. I'm not in the habit of making engagements in the
middle of the night. I'm a working gal."
 "Tomorrow's Sunday," I told her. "Well, anyway. I gotta get my beauty sleep. You know how it is."
 "I thought we might have just one cocktail together. It isn't too late."
 "Well. You're very sweet," she said. "Where ya callin' from? Where ya at now,
anyways?"
 "Me? I'm in a phone booth."
 "Oh," she said. Then there was this very long pause. "Well, I'd like awfully to get
together with you sometime, Mr. Cawffle. You sound very attractive. You sound like a
very attractive person. But it is late."
 "I could come up to your place."
 "Well, ordinary, I'd say grand. I mean I'd love to have you drop up for a cocktail,
but my roommate happens to be ill. She's been laying here all night without a wink of
sleep. She just this minute closed her eyes and all. I mean."
 "Oh. That's too bad."
 "Where ya stopping at? Perhaps we could get together for cocktails tomorrow."
 "I can't make it tomorrow," I said. "Tonight's the only time I can make it." What a
dope I was. I shouldn't've said that. "Oh. Well, I'm awfully sorry."
 "I'll say hello to Eddie for you."
 "Willya do that? I hope you enjoy your stay in New York. It's a grand place."
 "I know it is. Thanks. Good night," I said. Then I hung up. Boy, I really fouled that up. I should've at least made it for cocktails or something. 10
 It was still pretty early. I'm not sure what time it was, but it wasn't too late. The
one thing I hate to do is go to bed when I'm not even tired. So I opened my suitcases and
took out a clean shirt, and then I went in the bathroom and washed and changed my shirt. What I thought I'd do, I thought I'd go downstairs and see what the hell was going on in
the Lavender Room. They had this night club, the Lavender Room, in the hotel. While I was changing my shirt, I damn near gave my kid sister Phoebe a buzz,
though. I certainly felt like talking to her on the phone. Somebody with sense and all. But
I couldn't take a chance on giving her a buzz, because she was only a little kid and she
wouldn't have been up, let alone anywhere near the phone. I thought of maybe hanging
up if my parents answered, but that wouldn't've worked, either. They'd know it was me. My mother always knows it's me. She's psychic. But I certainly wouldn't have minded
shooting the crap with old Phoebe for a while. You should see her. You never saw a little kid so pretty and smart in your whole
life. She's really smart. I mean she's had all A's ever since she started school. As a matter
of fact, I'm the only dumb one in the family. My brother D.B.'s a writer and all, and my
brother Allie, the one that died, that I told you about, was a wizard. I'm the only really
dumb one. But you ought to see old Phoebe. She has this sort of red hair, a little bit like
Allie's was, that's very short in the summertime. In the summertime, she sticks it behind
her ears. She has nice, pretty little ears. In the wintertime, it's pretty long, though. Sometimes my mother braids it and sometimes she doesn't. It's really nice, though. She's
only ten. She's quite skinny, like me, but nice skinny. Roller-skate skinny. I watched her
once from the window when she was crossing over Fifth Avenue to go to the park, and
that's what she is, roller-skate skinny. You'd like her. I mean if you tell old Phoebe
something, she knows exactly what the hell you're talking about. I mean you can even
take her anywhere with you. If you take her to a lousy movie, for instance, she knows it's
a lousy movie. If you take her to a pretty good movie, she knows it's a pretty good movie. D.B. and I took her to see this French movie, The Baker's Wife, with Raimu in it. It killed
her. Her favorite is The 39 Steps, though, with Robert Donat. She knows the whole
goddam movie by heart, because I've taken her to see it about ten times. When old Donat
comes up to this Scotch farmhouse, for instance, when he's running away from the cops
and all, Phoebe'll say right out loud in the movie--right when the Scotch guy in the
picture says it--"Can you eat the herring?" She knows all the talk by heart. And when this
professor in the picture, that's really a German spy, sticks up his little finger with part of
the middle joint missing, to show Robert Donat, old Phoebe beats him to it--she holds up
her little finger at me in the dark, right in front of my face. She's all right. You'd like her. The only trouble is, she's a little too affectionate sometimes. She's very emotional, for a
child. She really is. Something else she does, she writes books all the time. Only, she
doesn't finish them. They're all about some kid named Hazel Weatherfield--only old
Phoebe spells it "Hazle." Old Hazle Weatherfield is a girl detective. She's supposed to be
an orphan, but her old man keeps showing up.

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
"이름이 뭐예요, 혹시 여쭤봐도 될까요?" 갑자기 그녀의 말투에 영국식 억양이 섞였다. "목소리가 좀 어리게 들리네요."
나는 웃었다. "칭찬 고맙습니다." 나는 아주 능글맞게 말했다. "제 이름은 홀든 콜필드입니다." 가짜 이름을 댈 걸 그랬다. 미처 그 생각을 못 했다.
"음, 보세요, 미스터 카우플. 한밤중에 약속을 잡는 건 제 습관이 아니에요. 전 일하는 여자거든요."
"내일은 일요일인데요." 나는 그녀에게 말했다.
"음, 어쨌든. 전 미인 잠을 좀 자야 해요. 아시잖아요."
"칵테일 한 잔만 같이 할까 했어요. 그리 늦은 시간도 아니고요."
"음. 참 다정하시네요." 그녀가 말했다. "어디서 전화 거시는 거예요? 지금은 어디 계신데요, 대체?"
"저요? 저는 공중전화 부스에 있어요."
"아." 그녀가 말했다. 그러더니 아주 긴 침묵이 흘렀다. "음, 미스터 카우플, 언젠가 꼭 만나고 싶어요. 목소리가 정말 매력적이세요. 아주 매력적인 분이신 것 같아요. 하지만 너무 늦었어요."
"제가 그쪽으로 갈 수도 있는데요."
"음, 보통 때 같으면 아주 좋다고 하겠죠. 칵테일 한 잔 하러 오시는 건 정말 환영인데, 제 룸메이트가 아파서요. 밤새도록 한숨도 못 자고 누워 있었거든요. 방금 막 눈을 붙였어요. 그러니까요."
"아. 안됐네요."
"어디에 머무세요? 내일 칵테일 한 잔 같이 할 수 있을까요?"
"내일은 안 돼요." 나는 말했다. "오늘 밤밖에 시간이 안 돼요." 내가 바보였다. 그런 말은 하지 말았어야 했다.
"아. 음, 정말 죄송해요."
"에디한테 안부 전해 드릴게요."
"정말 그래 주실 거예요? 뉴욕에서 즐거운 시간 보내시길 바라요. 정말 멋진 곳이죠."
"네, 알아요. 고맙습니다. 안녕히 주무세요." 나는 말했다. 그러고는 전화를 끊었다. 아, 내가 정말 망쳤다. 하다못해 칵테일 약속이라도 잡았어야 했다.
아직 꽤 이른 시간이었다. 몇 시였는지는 확실치 않지만, 너무 늦지는 않았다. 내가 제일 싫어하는 건 피곤하지도 않은데 잠자리에 드는 것이다. 그래서 나는 여행 가방을 열어 깨끗한 셔츠를 꺼낸 다음, 욕실로 가서 씻고 셔츠를 갈아입었다. 나는 아래층으로 내려가 라벤더 룸에서 도대체 무슨 일이 벌어지고 있는지나 볼까 생각했다. 호텔에 라벤더 룸이라는 나이트클럽이 있었다.
셔츠를 갈아입는 동안, 나는 여동생 피비에게 전화할 뻔했다. 분명 그녀와 전화로 이야기하고 싶었다. 사리 분별 있는 사람과 말이다. 하지만 감히 전화할 엄두가 나지 않았다. 아직 어린아이라 깨어있지도 않을 테고, 전화기 근처에는 더더욱 없을 테니까. 부모님이 받으면 끊을까도 생각했지만, 그것도 소용없을 터였다. 나인 걸 아실 테니까. 엄마는 언제나 내가 전화한 걸 아신다. 영매처럼 말이다. 하지만 잠시나마 피비와 실없는 소리라도 하며 시간을 보내는 건 싫지 않았을 것이다. 그녀를 봐야 한다. 살면서 그렇게 예쁘고 똑똑한 꼬마는 본 적 없을 것이다. 정말 똑똑하다. 그러니까, 학교에 입학한 이래 줄곧 올 A를 받았다. 사실 우리 가족 중 멍청한 건 나뿐이다. 형 디비는 작가고, 너한테 말했던 죽은 동생 앨리는 천재였다. 나만 정말 멍청하다. 하지만 피비를 봐야 한다. 앨리 머리처럼 여름에는 아주 짧은 붉은 머리칼을 가지고 있다. 여름에는 귀 뒤로 넘기고 다닌다. 예쁘고 작은 귀를 가졌다. 겨울에는 꽤 길다. 가끔 엄마가 땋아 주기도 하고 안 땋아 주기도 하는데, 정말 예쁘다. 겨우 열 살이다. 나처럼 꽤 말랐지만, 예쁘게 말랐다. 롤러스케이트처럼 마른 몸이다. 한번은 창문으로 피비가 5번가를 가로질러 공원으로 가는 걸 봤는데, 딱 그랬다. 롤러스케이트처럼 마른 몸이었다. 너도 그녀를 좋아할 것이다. 내 말은, 피비에게 뭔가 말하면 그녀는 네가 도대체 무슨 말을 하는지 정확히 안다. 그러니까 심지어 어디든 데리고 다닐 수 있다는 것이다. 예를 들어, 형편없는 영화에 데려가도 형편없는 영화인 줄 안다. 꽤 괜찮은 영화에 데려가면 꽤 괜찮은 영화인 줄 안다. 디비와 나는 그녀를 데리고 레뮤가 나오는 프랑스 영화 <제빵사의 아내>를 보러 갔다. 그녀는 그 영화에 푹 빠져버렸다. 하지만 그녀가 가장 좋아하는 영화는 로버트 도낫이 나오는 <39계단>이다. 그 빌어먹을 영화를 통째로 외울 정도다. 내가 한 열 번쯤 데리고 가서 보여줬기 때문이다. 예를 들어, 도낫이 경찰을 피해 스코틀랜드 농가에 도착했을 때, 피비는 영화 속 스코틀랜드 남자가 대사를 하는 바로 그 순간, 영화관에서 큰 소리로 외친다. "청어를 먹을 수 있겠나?" 그녀는 모든 대사를 통째로 외우고 있다. 그리고 영화 속에 나오는 교수, 사실은 독일 스파이인데, 로버트 도낫에게 가운데 손가락 관절 일부가 없는 새끼손가락을 들어 보일 때면, 피비는 그보다 먼저 행동한다. 어둠 속에서 내 얼굴 바로 앞에서 내게 자기 새끼손가락을 들어 보인단 말이다. 그녀는 괜찮다. 너도 그녀를 좋아할 것이다. 유일한 문제는, 가끔 너무 다정하다는 것이다. 어린아이치고는 감성적이다. 정말 그렇다. 또 다른 점은, 늘 책을 쓴다는 것이다. 다만, 끝까지 쓰지 못한다. 그 책들은 모두 헤이즐 웨더필드라는 아이에 대한 이야기인데, 피비는 '해즐'이라고 쓴다. 늙은 해즐 웨더필드는 여자 탐정이다. 고아라고 설정되어 있지만, 그 늙은 아버지가 계속 나타난다.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** 비격식적이고 대화체적인 1인칭 서술(Informal, conversational first-person narration). 화자 홀든 콜필드(Holden Caulfield)의 내면 독백과 주변 인물에 대한 냉소적이고 거침없는 판단이 큰 비중을 차지한다. 욕설, 비속어, 구어적인 표현이 빈번하게 사용되며, 독자에게 직접 말을 거는 듯한 친근하면서도 다소 거친 문어체(conversational yet rough literary style)의 특징을 지닌다. 화자의 염세적이고 산만한 심리 상태가 어조 전반에 반영되어야 한다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **내면 독백 (Internal Monologue):** 화자의 생각, 관찰, 판단이 여과 없이 드러나는 부분으로, 가장 비격식적이고 솔직한 어조(해체)를 유지한다. (예: "God, could that dopey girl dance.", "She was really a moron. But what a dancer.")
    *   **구어체 및 비속어 사용 (Use of Colloquialisms and Slang):** "oughta," "wudga say," "dopey," "stinking," "goddam," "Chrissake" 등 다양한 비격식 표현과 욕설을 원문의 강도와 뉘앙스를 살려 번역해야 한다. (예: "~할 거야," "뭐라 그랬어?," "멍청한," "빌어먹을," "젠장" 등)
    *   **반복 및 강조 (Repetition and Emphasis):** 특정 구문이나 감정의 반복을 통해 화자의 심리 상태나 강조를 표현한다. (예: "You really can dance," "Where you girls from?")
    *   **과장 및 풍자 (Exaggeration and Sarcasm):** 화자의 염세적이고 비판적인 시각을 드러내는 과장된 표현이나 비꼬는 듯한 어조를 유지한다.
    *   **불안정한 심리 묘사 (Depiction of unstable psychology):** 감정의 급변(칭찬→짜증→애정), 판단의 번복 등 화자의 불안정하고 변덕스러운 심리 상태를 대화와 서술 전반에 걸쳐 표현한다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden (I)**
    *   **Speaking to:** The blonde girl (금발 소녀).
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 처음에는 소녀의 춤 실력에 감탄하며 호감을 표현하고, 그녀에게 깊은 인상을 주려 노력한다. 하지만 소녀의 부주의함과 대화 불능에 이내 짜증과 경멸을 느끼며, 때로는 비꼬거나 무시하는 태도를 보인다. 동시에 순간적으로 그녀에게 애정을 느끼는 등 감정의 기복이 심하다. 때로는 사과하거나 애정을 표현하기도 한다. 전반적으로 자신감 있고, 건방지며, 변덕스러운 태도가 드러나야 한다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   **일반 대화 및 칭찬, 호의 표현:** 상대방을 의식하여 형식적으로 예의를 갖추는 듯한 **해요체**를 기본으로 사용하되, 홀든 특유의 건방지거나 가벼운 어조가 드러나도록 조절한다. (예: "~세요," "~어요," "~죠?")
        *   **짜증, 불만, 냉소, 무시 표현:** 홀든의 거칠고 염세적인 본성이 드러나는 부분으로, 냉소적이고 무례하며 건방진 어조를 살리기 위해 **해라체**나 **해체**를 과감하게 사용한다. (예: "~잖아," "~이냐," "~해," "~이다") 감탄사("Oh, Christ," "Jesus Christ," "for Chrissake")는 원문의 강한 어조와 맥락을 살려 번역한다.
        *   **사과할 때:** 잠시 예의를 차리는 듯한 **해요체**로 전환하여 변덕스러운 성격을 나타낸다. (예: "죄송해요.")
        *   **요약:** **해요체**를 기본으로 하되, 감정의 변화와 홀든의 실제 성격이 드러나는 부분에서는 **해라체**나 **해체**를 자유롭게 넘나들며 그의 불안정하고 복잡한 내면을 표현한다.

*   **Character: The blonde one (She)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden.
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 대화에 집중하지 못하고 주위가 산만하며, 홀든의 질문을 제대로 이해하지 못하거나 엉뚱한 대답을 자주 한다. 홀든의 무례한 언어나 과도한 신체 접촉에 대해서는 단호하게 불쾌감을 표현하며 자신만의 선을 지키려 한다. 전반적으로는 수동적이고 단순하며 다소 무관심한 태도를 보인다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   **일반 대화 및 무관심 표현:** 짧고 단순한 대답이 많으며, 다소 공허하거나 무관심한 느낌을 줄 수 있도록 **해요체**를 사용한다. (예: "뭐요?", "몰라요.")
        *   **불쾌감 및 불만 표현:** 홀든의 무례한 언행에 대해 단호하게 제지하거나 불만을 표현할 때도 격식을 벗어나지 않는 선에서 **해요체**를 사용하되, 어조를 단호하고 분명하게 가져간다. (예: "말 조심하세요, 괜찮으시다면요.", "그런 식의 말은 싫어요.")
        *   **다소 부자연스러운 격식:** "It's immaterial to me"와 같이 나이에 비해 다소 딱딱하거나 격식 있는 표현을 사용할 때는, 소녀의 어색하거나 다소 미숙한 듯한 느낌을 살려 약간 부자연스러운 **해요체**로 번역하거나, 평범한 **해요체**이되 문장 자체의 딱딱함을 유지한다.
        *   **요약:** 전반적으로 **해요체**를 사용하지만, 문맥에 따라 단호하거나, 무관심하거나, 때로는 다소 어색하게 격식을 차리는 뉘앙스를 담아내어 그녀의 단순하지만 '품위'를 지키려는 듯한 모습을 표현한다.

her. She was smart even when she was a very tiny little kid. When she was a very tiny
little kid, I and Allie used to take her to the park with us, especially on Sundays. Allie had
this sailboat he used to like to fool around with on Sundays, and we used to take old
Phoebe with us. She'd wear white gloves and walk right between us, like a lady and all. And when Allie and I were having some conversation about things in general, old
Phoebe'd be listening. Sometimes you'd forget she was around, because she was such a
little kid, but she'd let you know. She'd interrupt you all the time. She'd give Allie or I a
push or something, and say, "Who? Who said that? Bobby or the lady?" And we'd tell her
who said it, and she'd say, "Oh," and go right on listening and all. She killed Allie, too. I
mean he liked her, too. She's ten now, and not such a tiny little kid any more, but she still
kills everybody--everybody with any sense, anyway. Anyway, she was somebody you always felt like talking to on the phone. But I
was too afraid my parents would answer, and then they'd find out I was in New York and
kicked out of Pencey and all. So I just finished putting on my shirt. Then I got all ready
and went down in the elevator to the lobby to see what was going on. Except for a few pimpy-looking guys, and a few whory-looking blondes, the
lobby was pretty empty. But you could hear the band playing in the Lavender Room, and
so I went in there. It wasn't very crowded, but they gave me a lousy table anyway--way in
the back. I should've waved a buck under the head-waiter's nose. In New York, boy,
money really talks--I'm not kidding. The band was putrid. Buddy Singer. Very brassy, but not good brassy--corny
brassy. Also, there were very few people around my age in the place. In fact, nobody was
around my age. They were mostly old, show-offy-looking guys with their dates. Except at
the table right next to me. At the table right next to me, there were these three girls
around thirty or so. The whole three of them were pretty ugly, and they all had on the
kind of hats that you knew they didn't really live in New York, but one of them, the
blonde one, wasn't too bad. She was sort of cute, the blonde one, and I started giving her
the old eye a little bit, but just then the waiter came up for my order. I ordered a Scotch
and soda, and told him not to mix it--I said it fast as hell, because if you hem and haw,
they think you're under twenty-one and won't sell you any intoxicating liquor. I had
trouble with him anyway, though. "I'm sorry, sir," he said, "but do you have some
verification of your age? Your driver's license, perhaps?"
 I gave him this very cold stare, like he'd insulted the hell out of me, and asked
him, "Do I look like I'm under twenty-one?"
 "I'm sorry, sir, but we have our--"
 "Okay, okay," I said. I figured the hell with it. "Bring me a Coke." He started to
go away, but I called him back. "Can'tcha stick a little rum in it or something?" I asked
him. I asked him very nicely and all. "I can't sit in a corny place like this cold sober. Can'tcha stick a little rum in it or something?"
 "I'm very sorry, sir. . ." he said, and beat it on me. I didn't hold it against him,
though. They lose their jobs if they get caught selling to a minor. I'm a goddam minor. I started giving the three witches at the next table the eye again. That is, the
blonde one. The other two were strictly from hunger. I didn't do it crudely, though. I just
gave all three of them this very cool glance and all. What they did, though, the three of
them, when I did it, they started giggling like morons. They probably thought I was too
young to give anybody the once-over. That annoyed hell out of me-- you'd've thought I
wanted to marry them or something. I should've given them the freeze, after they did that,
but the trouble was, I really felt like dancing. I'm very fond of dancing, sometimes, and
that was one of the times. So all of a sudden, I sort of leaned over and said, "Would any
of you girls care to dance?" I didn't ask them crudely or anything. Very suave, in fact. But
God damn it, they thought that was a panic, too. They started giggling some more. I'm
not kidding, they were three real morons. "C'mon," I said. "I'll dance with you one at a
time. All right? How 'bout it? C'mon!" I really felt like dancing. Finally, the blonde one got up to dance with me, because you could tell I was
really talking to her, and we walked out to the dance floor. The other two grools nearly
had hysterics when we did. I certainly must've been very hard up to even bother with any
of them. But it was worth it. The blonde was some dancer. She was one of the best dancers
I ever danced with. I'm not kidding, some of these very stupid girls can really knock you
out on a dance floor. You take a really smart girl, and half the time she's trying to lead
you around the dance floor, or else she's such a lousy dancer, the best thing to do is stay
at the table and just get drunk with her.

그래서 갑자기 몸을 살짝 기울여서 물었어. "어떤 분이든 춤추실 분 계세요?" 야하게 묻거나 그런 거 아니었어. 사실은 아주 능글맞게 물었지. 그런데 젠장, 걔네는 그것도 엄청 웃긴다고 생각하는 거야. 또 킥킥거리기 시작했어. 농담 아니고, 걔네는 진짜 바보들 세 명이었어. "자, 이리 와," 내가 말했어. "한 명씩 춤춰 줄게. 알았지? 어때? 자!" 나는 정말 춤추고 싶었거든.

마침내 금발 여자애가 나랑 춤추러 일어났어, 내가 정말 걔한테 말하고 있다는 걸 알았는지 말이야, 그리고 우리는 댄스 플로어로 나갔어. 우리가 그렇게 하니까 다른 두 못생긴 년들은 거의 발광을 하더라. 걔네한테 굳이 신경 쓸 정도로 내가 정말 궁했나 싶었어. 하지만 그럴 만한 가치가 있었지. 그 금발 여자애는 춤을 기가 막히게 췄어. 내가 같이 춤춰본 여자 중에 최고였어. 농담 아니고, 이 아주 멍청한 여자애들 중 몇몇은 댄스 플로어에서 진짜 넋을 빼놓을 수 있다니까. 정말 똑똑한 여자애를 데려가면, 절반은 지가 이끌려고 하거나, 아니면 춤을 너무 형편없이 춰서, 최고는 그냥 테이블에 앉아 술이나 퍼마시는 게 최고야.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** 이 지문은 서술자의 매우 비격식적이고 구어체적인 개인의 독백으로 이루어져 있습니다. 마치 독자에게 직접 말을 거는 듯한 강렬한 구어체적 특성을 지니며, 약간 염세적이고 냉소적이며 비판적인 시선이 두드러집니다. 생각의 흐름(stream-of-consciousness)을 따라 자유롭게 전개되며, 특정 대상에 대한 불평과 판단이 잦습니다. 전반적으로 문어체적 딱딱함이 배제된, 매우 직설적이고 솔직한 어조를 유지해야 합니다.
    *   **추천 어조:** 직설적이고 거침없는 **해라체(平叙体)**를 기본으로 하되, 비속어와 구어적인 표현을 자연스럽게 녹여내어 서술자의 시니컬하고 불평 많은 성격을 드러냅니다. 때로는 독백조의 **반말(非敬語)** 느낌을 살려 친밀하면서도 무심한 어조를 유지하는 것이 중요합니다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **내적 독백 (Internal monologue) / 의식의 흐름 (Stream of consciousness):** 서술자의 생각, 감정, 판단이 여과 없이 드러납니다. 번역 시 서술자의 내면 심리를 생생하게 전달할 수 있도록 한국어의 다양한 어미와 조사를 활용하여 유연한 문장 흐름을 만드세요.
    *   **반어/풍자 (Irony/Sarcasm):** 겉으로는 칭찬하는 듯하지만 속으로는 비꼬는 듯한 표현("She had a sterling sense of humor," "Was she corny")이 자주 나타납니다. 한국어의 뉘앙스를 살려 비꼬는 어조를 명확히 표현해야 합니다.
    *   **반복 (Repetition):** "Old Marty," "the whole three of them," "as hell"과 같은 반복적인 표현은 서술자의 습관적 어투를 반영하므로, 한국어에서도 유사한 효과를 낼 수 있는 반복 어구를 고려해야 합니다.
    *   **과장 (Hyperbole):** "nearly committed suicide," "was murder," "dragging the Statue of Liberty" 등 과장된 표현을 통해 서술자의 감정과 상황에 대한 인식을 강조합니다.
    *   **구어체/비속어 (Colloquialisms/Expletives):** "goddam," "lousy," "shoot," "kidded" 등 비격식적인 표현과 비속어가 자주 사용됩니다. 한국어의 유사한 비속어나 구어체 표현을 사용하여 서술자의 개성을 살리되, 너무 과하거나 부자연스럽지 않도록 주의합니다.
    *   **독자에게 직접 말하는 듯한 어투 (Direct address):** 서술자가 독자에게 직접 이야기하듯 진행되는 느낌을 살립니다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Narrator (Holden)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Marty
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 춤이 서툰 마티를 즐겁게 해주려는(동시에 자신을 달래려는) 장난기 넘치고 약간은 비꼬는 듯한 거짓말을 할 때. 이후 자신의 행동에 대한 후회("sorry as hell I'd kidded her")를 표현할 때는 솔직하고 자조적인 느낌을 줍니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   **대화체:** 장난치거나 거짓말을 할 때는 다소 건방지거나 무심한 듯한 **해라체(平叙体)**나 반말에 가까운 **해요체(丁寧体)**를 사용하여 상대를 놀리는 듯한 어조를 표현합니다.
        *   **내적 독백:** 후회나 자조적인 생각은 서술 문체와 동일하게 **해라체(平叙体)**를 사용하되, 감정의 변화를 드러내는 어미를 활용합니다.

*   **Character: Marty**
    *   **Speaking to:** Narrator (Holden)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 게리 쿠퍼를 봤다는 말에 "excited as hell"처럼 극도로 흥분하고 들뜬 상태. 이후 게리 쿠퍼를 놓쳤다는 말에 "Oh, shoot!"처럼 순진하게 실망하는 모습을 보입니다. 전반적으로 다소 순진하고 세상 물정 모르는 듯한 '촌스러운' 인물입니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   **들뜬 상태:** 매우 들뜬 감정을 표현하기 위해 감탄사를 적극 활용하고, **해요체(丁寧体)**나 혹은 격식 없는 상황에서 사용하는 **해(非敬語)**를 사용하여 순진하고 흥분된 어조를 표현합니다. 질문("Where?")은 반복을 통해 간절함을 강조합니다.
        *   **실망:** "Oh, shoot!"은 간결하고 순진한 실망을 나타내는 감탄사로, **아이고!** 또는 **어휴!** 와 같은 짧은 탄식을 **해요체(丁寧体)**나 격식 없는 **해(非敬語)**와 함께 사용합니다.

*   **Character: Bernice**
    *   **Speaking to:** Narrator (Holden)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 서술자가 무언가를 물을 때마다 "What?"이라고만 답하며, 무기력하고 무관심한 태도를 보입니다. 서술자는 이를 매우 짜증스럽게 여깁니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 한 단어 "What?"을 무미건조하고 반응 없는 태도를 나타내도록 번역합니다. "뭐?" 또는 "네?" 와 같이 짧고 단답형인 **해(非敬語)** 또는 **해요체(丁寧体)**를 사용하되, 무표정하고 무관심한 뉘앙스를 전달하는 것이 중요합니다.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
"You really can dance," I told the blonde one. "You oughta be a pro. I mean it. I
danced with a pro once, and you're twice as good as she was. Did you ever hear of Marco
and Miranda?"
 "What?" she said. She wasn't even listening to me. She was looking all around the
place. "I said did you ever hear of Marco and Miranda?"
 "I don't know. No. I don't know."
 "Well, they're dancers, she's a dancer. She's not too hot, though. She does
everything she's supposed to, but she's not so hot anyway. You know when a girl's really
a terrific dancer?"
 "Wudga say?" she said. She wasn't listening to me, even. Her mind was
wandering all over the place. "I said do you know when a girl's really a terrific dancer?"
 "Uh-uh."
 "Well--where I have my hand on your back. If I think there isn't anything
underneath my hand--no can, no legs, no feet, no anything--then the girl's really a terrific
dancer."
 She wasn't listening, though. So I ignored her for a while. We just danced. God,
could that dopey girl dance. Buddy Singer and his stinking band was playing "Just One of
Those Things" and even they couldn't ruin it entirely. It's a swell song. I didn't try any
trick stuff while we danced--I hate a guy that does a lot of show-off tricky stuff on the
dance floor--but I was moving her around plenty, and she stayed with me. The funny
thing is, I thought she was enjoying it, too, till all of a sudden she came out with this very
dumb remark. "I and my girl friends saw Peter Lorre last night," she said. "The movie
actor. In person. He was buyin' a newspaper. He's cute."
 "You're lucky," I told her. "You're really lucky. You know that?" She was really a
moron. But what a dancer. I could hardly stop myself from sort of giving her a kiss on the
top of her dopey head--you know-- right where the part is, and all. She got sore when I
did it. "Hey! What's the idea?"
 "Nothing. No idea. You really can dance," I said. "I have a kid sister that's only in
the goddam fourth grade. You're about as good as she is, and she can dance better than
anybody living or dead."
 "Watch your language, if you don't mind."
 What a lady, boy. A queen, for Chrissake. "Where you girls from?" I asked her. She didn't answer me, though. She was busy looking around for old Peter Lorre to
show up, I guess. "Where you girls from?" I asked her again. "What?" she said. "Where you girls from? Don't answer if you don't feel like it. I don't want you to
strain yourself."
 "Seattle, Washington," she said. She was doing me a big favor to tell me. "You're a very good conversationalist," I told her. "You know that?"
 "What?"
 I let it drop. It was over her head, anyway. "Do you feel like jitterbugging a little
bit, if they play a fast one? Not corny jitterbug, not jump or anything--just nice and easy. Everybody'll all sit down when they play a fast one, except the old guys and the fat guys,
and we'll have plenty of room. Okay?"
 "It's immaterial to me," she said. "Hey--how old are you, anyhow?"
 That annoyed me, for some reason. "Oh, Christ. Don't spoil it," I said. "I'm
twelve, for Chrissake. I'm big for my age."
 "Listen. I toleja about that. I don't like that type language," she said. "If you're
gonna use that type language, I can go sit down with my girl friends, you know."
 I apologized like a madman, because the band was starting a fast one. She started
jitterbugging with me-- but just very nice and easy, not corny. She was really good. All
you had to do was touch her. And when she turned around, her pretty little butt twitched
so nice and all. She knocked me out. I mean it. I was half in love with her by the time we
sat down. That's the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty, even if
they're not much to look at, or even if they're sort of stupid, you fall half in love with
them, and then you never know where the hell you are. Girls. Jesus Christ. They can
drive you crazy. They really can. They didn't invite me to sit down at their table-- mostly because they were too
ignorant--but I sat down anyway. The blonde I'd been dancing with's name was Bernice
something--Crabs or Krebs. The two ugly ones' names were Marty and Laverne. I told
them my name was Jim Steele, just for the hell of it. Then I tried to get them in a little
intelligent conversation, but it was practically impossible. You had to twist their arms. You could hardly tell which was the stupidest of the three of them. And the whole three
of them kept looking all around the goddam room, like as if they expected a flock of
goddam movie stars to come in any minute. They probably thought movie stars always
hung out in the Lavender Room when they came to New York, instead of the Stork Club
or El Morocco and all. Anyway, it took me about a half hour to find out where they all
worked and all in Seattle. They all worked in the same insurance office. I asked them if
they liked it, but do you think you could get an intelligent answer out of those three
dopes? I thought the two ugly ones, Marty and Laverne, were sisters, but they got very
insulted when I asked them. You could tell neither one of them wanted to look like the
other one, and you couldn't blame them, but it was very amusing anyway.

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
"춤 정말 잘 추시네요," 내가 금발 여자애에게 말했어. "프로가 되셔야겠어요. 진심이에요. 저 프로랑 한 번 춤춰봤는데, 그 여자보다 당신이 두 배는 더 잘 춰요. 마르코랑 미란다라고 들어본 적 있어요?"
"뭐라고요?" 그 여자가 말했어. 내 말은 듣지도 않고 있었어. 사방을 둘러보고 있더라. "마르코랑 미란다 들어본 적 있냐고요?"
"몰라요. 아니요. 몰라요."
"음, 걔네는 댄서예요, 그 여자가 댄서라고요. 근데 그렇게 대단하진 않아요. 시키는 건 다 하는데, 아무튼 그렇게 대단하진 않다고요. 여자가 정말 대단한 댄서인 순간을 알아요?"
"뭐라고 하셨어요?" 그 여자가 말했어. 내 말은 또 듣지도 않고 있었어. 정신이 온통 딴 데 팔려 있더라. "여자가 정말 대단한 댄서인 순간을 아느냐고요?"
"아니요."
"음—내 손이 당신 등 위에 있잖아요. 만약 내 손 밑에 아무것도 없다고 생각되면—엉덩이도, 다리도, 발도, 아무것도—그럼 그 여자는 정말 대단한 댄서라는 거죠."
그런데도 그 여잔 듣지 않았어. 그래서 한동안은 그냥 무시했지. 우리는 그냥 춤만 췄어. 젠장, 그 멍청한 년 춤은 기가 막히게 췄어. 버디 싱어와 그 빌어먹을 밴드가 '그냥 그런 일 중 하나'를 연주하고 있었는데, 걔네조차도 그 곡을 완전히 망칠 수는 없었어. 아주 멋진 노래거든. 우리는 춤추는 동안 잔재주 부리려 하지 않았어—댄스 플로어에서 잘난 척하며 잔재주 많이 부리는 녀석들은 질색이거든—그래도 나는 그 여자를 이리저리 많이 움직였고, 그 여잔 나를 잘 따라왔어. 웃긴 건, 나도 그 여자가 즐거워하는 줄 알았다는 거야, 갑자기 아주 멍청한 소리를 지껄이기 전까지는 말이야. "어젯밤에 나랑 내 친구들이 피터 로어 봤어요," 그 여자가 말했어. "그 영화배우요. 직접 봤어요. 신문 사고 있었어요. 귀여워요."
"운 좋으시네요," 내가 말했어. "진짜 운 좋으시네요. 알아요?" 걔는 진짜 바보였어. 그런데 춤은 기가 막혔지. 나도 모르게 그 멍청한 대가리 꼭대기—그러니까 가르마 탄 바로 그 부분—에 키스를 할 뻔했어. 내가 그러자 그 여자가 화를 내는 거야. "이봐요! 무슨 짓이에요?"
"아무것도 아니에요. 별 뜻 없어요. 춤 정말 잘 추네요," 내가 말했어. "내게는 빌어먹을 4학년밖에 안 된 어린 여동생이 있어요. 당신은 걔만큼이나 잘 추고, 걔는 산 사람이든 죽은 사람이든 누구보다도 춤을 잘 춰요."
"말 조심하세요, 괜찮으시다면요."
숙녀 나셨네, 빌어먹을. 여왕 납셨어, 젠장. "아가씨들 어디서 왔어요?" 내가 물었어. 그런데도 그 여잔 대답하지 않았어. 늙은 피터 로어라도 나타날까 봐 사방을 둘러보느라 바빴던 것 같아. "아가씨들 어디서 왔냐고요?" 내가 다시 물었어. "뭐라고요?" 그 여자가 말했어. "아가씨들 어디서 왔냐고요? 대답하기 싫으면 안 해도 돼요. 무리하게 하고 싶진 않으니까요."
"시애틀, 워싱턴이요," 그 여자가 말했어. 나한테 큰 은혜라도 베푸는 양 말하더라. "말씀을 아주 잘하시네요," 내가 말했어. "알아요?"
"뭐라고요?"
나는 그 말을 접었어. 어차피 그 여자 머리로는 이해 못 할 소리였으니까. "빠른 곡 나오면 지터버그 좀 춰볼래요? 촌스러운 지터버그 말고, 점프하거나 그런 거 말고—그냥 부드럽고 편안하게요. 빠른 곡 나오면 늙은 아저씨들이랑 뚱뚱한 아저씨들 빼고는 다 앉을 테니까, 공간도 충분할 거예요. 괜찮아요?"
"저한테는 상관없어요," 그 여자가 말했어. "저기—근데 몇 살이에요, 당신은?"
그게 왠지 짜증이 나는 거야. "오, 젠장. 망치지 마요," 내가 말했어. "나 열두 살이라고, 젠장. 나이치곤 큰 편이고."
"들어요. 제가 그거 말했잖아요. 그런 식의 말은 싫어요," 그 여자가 말했어. "계속 그런 식의 말 쓸 거면, 저 친구들한테 가서 앉을 수 있어요, 알죠?"
나는 미친 듯이 사과했어, 밴드가 빠른 곡을 시작하고 있었거든. 그 여자는 나랑 지터버그를 추기 시작했어—그런데 아주 부드럽고 편안하게, 촌스럽지 않게 말이야. 그 여잔 정말 잘 췄어. 그저 살짝 건드리기만 하면 됐어. 그리고 그 여자가 돌아설 때, 예쁜 작은 엉덩이가 그렇게 멋지게 씰룩거리는 거야. 나는 완전히 넋이 나갔어. 진심이야. 우리가 앉을 때쯤엔 그 여자한테 반쯤 사랑에 빠져 있었어. 여자애들은 다 그래. 예쁜 짓을 할 때마다, 볼품없거나 좀 멍청해도, 반쯤 사랑에 빠지게 되고, 그럼 대체 내가 어디 있는지 알 수 없게 돼. 여자애들. 젠장할. 사람 미치게 한다니까. 진짜 그래.
걔네는 나를 자기들 테이블에 앉으라고 초대하지 않았어—주로 너무 무식해서 그랬겠지만—그래도 나는 그냥 앉았지. 내가 춤췄던 금발 여자애 이름은 베니스 뭐더라—크랩스나 크렙스였어. 못생긴 두 년 이름은 마티랑 라번이었고. 나는 그냥 심심풀이로 내 이름이 짐 스틸이라고 말해줬어. 그러고 나서 걔네랑 좀 지적인 대화를 해보려 했는데, 거의 불가능했어. 억지로 시켜야 할 정도였지. 걔네 셋 중에 누가 가장 멍청한지 분간하기조차 힘들었어. 그리고 걔네 셋 다 빌어먹을 방 안을 계속 둘러보는 거야, 마치 빌어먹을 영화배우들이 당장이라도 떼거리로 들어올 거라고 기대하는 것처럼 말이야. 아마 걔네는 영화배우들이 뉴욕에 오면 스토크 클럽이나 엘 모로코 같은 데 말고 라벤더 룸에서만 어슬렁거리는 줄 알았나 봐. 아무튼, 시애틀 어디에서 일하는지 알아내는 데 한 삼십 분은 걸린 것 같아. 셋 다 같은 보험 회사에서 일하더라고. 내가 좋으냐고 물어봤는데, 그 멍청이 세 명한테서 지적인 대답을 얻을 수 있을 것 같아? 못생긴 두 년, 마티랑 라번이 자매인 줄 알았는데, 내가 물어보니까 엄청 기분 나빠하는 거야. 둘 다 서로 닮고 싶어 하지 않는 게 딱 보였는데, 뭐라 할 수도 없었지, 그래도 아무튼 아주 웃겼어.

--- CONTEXT FOR SEGMENT 28 ---

### Static Rules Used:
Global Style: Translate the narration in a formal, literary style (문어체). Avoid overly academic or stiff expressions. The tone should be immersive and engaging for a novel reader.

### AI-Generated Guidelines Used:
Key Term Translations:

Maine: 메인

Style and Tone Analysis:
Here are the guidelines for the translator, focusing on consistency and context-aware tone:

### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is highly informal, conversational, and deeply personal, adopting a stream-of-consciousness style. It feels like a young man recounting past events directly to the reader, complete with frequent digressions, slang, and colloquialisms. There's an underlying tone of casual observation, sometimes cynical, sometimes nostalgic, and often blunt. It conveys a strong sense of the narrator's unique personality and inner world, as if he's speaking off the cuff.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **1인칭 구어체 서술 (First-person conversational narration):** This is the defining characteristic. The narrative should closely mimic natural, unedited speech, reflecting the narrator's thoughts, feelings, and memories as they occur. The primary speech style for the narration should be **해라체 (hae-ra-che)**, as it best captures the informal, candid, and personal tone of someone sharing their unfiltered thoughts and experiences. For moments of more personal reflection or slight softness, a subtle shift towards a less blunt **해라체** or even a very informal **해요체 (hae-yo-che)** might be considered, but consistency in the rougher **해라체** is key for the overall voice.
    *   **구어체 표현/속어 (Colloquialisms/Slang):** The text is rich with informal expressions and slang (e.g., "made a big stink," "helluva time," "didn't give a good goddam," "booze hound," "raining like a bastard," "kid the pants off," "muckle-mouthed"). These must be translated with equivalent Korean informal/colloquial expressions and slang to preserve the original flavor and the narrator's authentic voice. Avoid overly formal or standard dictionary translations where a more vivid, everyday Korean equivalent exists.
    *   **의식의 흐름/잦은 탈선 (Stream of consciousness/Frequent digressions):** The narrator frequently veers off topic to share personal opinions, anecdotes, or observations (e.g., his golf skills, his disdain for movies, his mother's personality, his thoughts on kidding girls). This spontaneity, non-linear storytelling, and the feeling of an unedited thought process are crucial to preserve. Use appropriate Korean conjunctions and sentence structures that mimic natural conversational flow and digressions.
    *   **절제된 표현/약간의 냉소 (Understatement/Slight cynicism):** A subtle, often world-weary or detached tone can be observed, particularly when describing adults or societal norms. This should be conveyed through word choice and nuance.
    *   **강조를 위한 반복 (Repetition for emphasis):** Phrases or words are sometimes repeated for emphasis (e.g., "Eight. I had a terrible time..."). This stylistic choice should be maintained.
    *   **생생하고 때로는 거친 묘사 (Vivid, sometimes blunt descriptions):** Descriptions are often direct and unvarnished, contributing to the narrator's authentic, slightly rough-around-the-edges voice.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines
No direct, quoted dialogue is present in this segment. All interactions are reported speech or described actions. The primary focus for maintaining tone should therefore be on the **narrator's voice** as detailed above.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
I danced with them all--the whole three of them--one at a time. The one ugly one,
Laverne, wasn't too bad a dancer, but the other one, old Marty, was murder. Old Marty
was like dragging the Statue of Liberty around the floor. The only way I could even half
enjoy myself dragging her around was if I amused myself a little. So I told her I just saw
Gary Cooper, the movie star, on the other side of the floor. "Where?" she asked me--excited as hell. "Where?"
 "Aw, you just missed him. He just went out. Why didn't you look when I told
you?"
 She practically stopped dancing, and started looking over everybody's heads to
see if she could see him. "Oh, shoot!" she said. I'd just about broken her heart-- I really
had. I was sorry as hell I'd kidded her. Some people you shouldn't kid, even if they
deserve it. Here's what was very funny, though. When we got back to the table, old Marty
told the other two that Gary Cooper had just gone out. Boy, old Laverne and Bernice
nearly committed suicide when they heard that. They got all excited and asked Marty if
she'd seen him and all. Old Mart said she'd only caught a glimpse of him. That killed me. The bar was closing up for the night, so I bought them all two drinks apiece quick
before it closed, and I ordered two more Cokes for myself. The goddam table was lousy
with glasses. The one ugly one, Laverne, kept kidding me because I was only drinking
Cokes. She had a sterling sense of humor. She and old Marty were drinking Tom
Collinses--in the middle of December, for God's sake. They didn't know any better. The
blonde one, old Bernice, was drinking bourbon and water. She was really putting it away,
too. The whole three of them kept looking for movie stars the whole time. They hardly
talked--even to each other. Old Marty talked more than the other two. She kept saying
these very corny, boring things, like calling the can the "little girls' room," and she
thought Buddy Singer's poor old beat-up clarinet player was really terrific when he stood
up and took a couple of ice-cold hot licks. She called his clarinet a "licorice stick." Was
she corny. The other ugly one, Laverne, thought she was a very witty type. She kept
asking me to call up my father and ask him what he was doing tonight. She kept asking
me if my father had a date or not. Four times she asked me that--she was certainly witty. Old Bernice, the blonde one, didn't say hardly anything at all. Every time I'd ask her
something, she said "What?" That can get on your nerves after a while. All of a sudden, when they finished their drink, all three of them stood up on me
and said they had to get to bed. They said they were going to get up early to see the first
show at Radio City Music Hall. I tried to get them to stick around for a while, but they
wouldn't. So we said good-by and all. I told them I'd look them up in Seattle sometime, if
I ever got there, but I doubt if I ever will. Look them up, I mean. With cigarettes and all, the check came to about thirteen bucks. I think they
should've at least offered to pay for the drinks they had before I joined them--I
wouldn't've let them, naturally, but they should've at least offered. I didn't care much,
though. They were so ignorant, and they had those sad, fancy hats on and all. And that
business about getting up early to see the first show at Radio City Music Hall depressed
me. If somebody, some girl in an awful-looking hat, for instance, comes all the way to
New York--from Seattle, Washington, for God's sake--and ends up getting up early in the
morning to see the goddam first show at Radio City Music Hall, it makes me so
depressed I can't stand it. I'd've bought the whole three of them a hundred drinks if only
they hadn't told me that. I left the Lavender Room pretty soon after they did. They were closing it up
anyway, and the band had quit a long time ago. In the first place, it was one of those
places that are very terrible to be in unless you have somebody good to dance with, or
unless the waiter lets you buy real drinks instead of just Cokes. There isn't any night club
in the world you can sit in for a long time unless you can at least buy some liquor and get
drunk. Or unless you're with some girl that really knocks you out. 11
 All of a sudden, on my way out to the lobby, I got old Jane Gallagher on the brain
again. I got her on, and I couldn't get her off. I sat down in this vomity-looking chair in
the lobby and thought about her and Stradlater sitting in that goddam Ed Banky's car, and
though I was pretty damn sure old Stradlater hadn't given her the time--I know old Jane
like a book--I still couldn't get her off my brain. I knew her like a book. I really did. I
mean, besides checkers, she was quite fond of all athletic sports, and after I got to know
her, the whole summer long we played tennis together almost every morning and golf
almost every afternoon. I really got to know her quite intimately. I don't mean it was
anything physical or anything--it wasn't--but we saw each other all the time. You don't
always have to get too sexy to get to know a girl.

걔네가 떠난 후 얼마 안 돼서 나도 라벤더 룸을 나왔지. 어차피 문 닫고 있었고, 밴드도 한참 전에 그만뒀었거든. 우선, 거기는 함께 춤출 만한 괜찮은 사람이 있거나, 아니면 웨이터가 콜라 대신 진짜 술을 사게 해주지 않는 한 정말 최악인 곳 중 하나였어. 최소한 술이라도 좀 사서 취할 수 있지 않는 한, 세상 어느 나이트클럽이든 오래 앉아 있을 수는 없어. 아니면 너를 완전히 뿅 가게 하는 여자애랑 같이 있거나 말이야.

갑자기, 로비로 나가는 길에, 늙은 제인 갤러거가 다시 머릿속에 떠올랐어. 한 번 떠오르니까 지워지지가 않는 거야. 로비에 있는 이 구역질 나는 의자에 앉아서 그녀랑 스트래드레이터가 빌어먹을 에드 뱅키 차에 앉아 있던 걸 생각했어. 늙은 스트래드레이터가 그녀랑 무슨 짓도 안 했다는 걸 거의 확신했지만—늙은 제인은 속속들이 다 아니까—그래도 여전히 그녀가 머릿속에서 떠나질 않았어. 나는 그 애를 손바닥 보듯 알았거든. 진짜로. 내 말은, 체스 말고도 그 애는 모든 운동 경기를 아주 좋아했고, 내가 그 애를 알게 된 후로 여름 내내 거의 매일 아침 테니스를 같이 치고 거의 매일 오후 골프를 같이 쳤어. 나는 그 애를 아주 깊이 알게 된 거지. 그게 무슨 신체적인 거라거나 그런 뜻은 아니야—아니었어—하지만 우리는 늘 서로를 봤으니까. 여자애를 알게 되기 위해 항상 너무 야해질 필요는 없잖아.

Style and Tone Analysis:
Here are the practical and actionable guidelines for translating the provided text segment:

### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** 이 지문은 홀든 콜필드의 1인칭 시점으로, 매우 **구어체(口語體, colloquial style)**적이고 사적인 독백입니다. 그의 독백은 청소년기의 불안정하고 솔직하며, 때로는 냉소적이고 비판적이지만 동시에 깊은 외로움과 순수함이 드러나는 복합적인 감정을 담고 있습니다. 전체적인 분위기는 꾸밈없고, 날것의 감정을 여과 없이 드러내는 **의식의 흐름(stream of consciousness)** 기법을 따르므로, 문장이 매끄럽기보다는 다소 거칠고 비약적으로 느껴질 수 있습니다. 독자가 홀든의 머릿속을 직접 들여다보는 듯한 친밀하고도 비공식적인 어조를 유지해야 합니다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **1인칭 시점(First-person narration):** 홀든의 독특한 시각과 목소리를 가장 중요하게 유지해야 합니다.
    *   **의식의 흐름(Stream of consciousness):** 생각의 흐름이 자유롭게 이어지며, 때로는 비논리적으로 주제가 전환되는 방식을 보존하여 홀든의 심리 상태를 반영해야 합니다.
    *   **구어체 및 속어 사용(Use of colloquialisms and slang):** "goddam," "bastard," "vomity-looking," "whory-looking" 등 홀든이 사용하는 비속어와 구어적인 표현들을 한국어의 유사한 비공식적이거나 약간 거친 표현(예: '빌어먹을', '젠장', '짜증나는', '창녀 같은')으로 자연스럽게 번역하되, 과도하게 저속하거나 부자연스럽지 않도록 주의해야 합니다. 그의 나이와 인물을 고려한 어휘를 선택해야 합니다.
    *   **반복과 과장(Repetition and Hyperbole):** 강조를 위해 반복되는 어휘(예: "goddam")나 과장된 표현("just about kills you," "drove me crazy")을 한국어에서도 유사하게 살려 홀든의 감정 상태를 효과적으로 전달해야 합니다.
    *   **감정의 이중성(Emotional duality):** 겉으로는 냉소적이고 세상에 대해 불평하지만, 내면에는 순수함, 애정, 외로움이 공존하는 홀든의 복합적인 감정선을 섬세하게 표현해야 합니다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines
*   **No direct dialogue between characters within this segment.** The entire text is Holden Caulfield's first-person narration. The following guidelines apply to Holden's narrative voice, which serves as his 'speaking style' to the reader.

*   **Character: 홀든 콜필드 (Holden Caulfield) - 서술자(Narrator)**
    *   **Speaking to:** 독자(Reader) / 자기 자신(Self - internal thoughts)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 홀든은 자신의 경험, 생각, 감정을 독자에게 직접적으로 털어놓고 있습니다. 그는 과거의 회상과 현재의 관찰을 넘나들며, 때로는 향수에 젖고, 좌절하며, 분노하고, 우울해하고, 연약한 모습을 보이기도 합니다. 그의 솔직하고 때로는 거친 언어는 그의 내면을 그대로 드러냅니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   주로 **해라체(Haera-che)**를 사용하여 홀든의 직접적이고 꾸밈없는 진술, 관찰, 묘사를 표현합니다. 이는 청소년 특유의 반항적이면서도 현실에 대한 냉소적인 어조를 잘 나타냅니다.
        *   홀든의 보다 개인적이고 내면적인 감정, 회상, 의식의 흐름을 표현할 때는 **해체(Hae-che)**를 적절히 혼용하여 독자와의 친밀감을 높이고, 마치 독자가 그의 생각 속에 직접 들어와 있는 듯한 느낌을 주어야 합니다.
        *   **해요체(Haeyo-che)**나 **하십시오체(Hasipsio-che)**와 같은 정중한 높임말은 홀든의 성격과 독백의 성격에 전혀 맞지 않으므로 사용을 지양해야 합니다.
        *   문장은 다소 길고 복잡하며, 생각의 흐름에 따라 비약적으로 이어질 수 있으므로, 이러한 리듬과 구성을 살려 번역합니다. 그의 어휘 선택은 나이에 맞는 구어적이고 때로는 다소 거친 표현을 포함해야 합니다.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
The way I met her, this Doberman pinscher she had used to come over and relieve
himself on our lawn, and my mother got very irritated about it. She called up Jane's
mother and made a big stink about it. My mother can make a very big stink about that
kind of stuff. Then what happened, a couple of days later I saw Jane laying on her
stomach next to the swimming pool, at the club, and I said hello to her. I knew she lived
in the house next to ours, but I'd never conversed with her before or anything. She gave
me the big freeze when I said hello that day, though. I had a helluva time convincing her
that I didn't give a good goddam where her dog relieved himself. He could do it in the
living room, for all I cared. Anyway, after that, Jane and I got to be friends and all. I
played golf with her that same afternoon. She lost eight balls, I remember. Eight. I had a
terrible time getting her to at least open her eyes when she took a swing at the ball. I
improved her game immensely, though. I'm a very good golfer. If I told you what I go
around in, you probably wouldn't believe me. I almost was once in a movie short, but I
changed my mind at the last minute. I figured that anybody that hates the movies as much
as I do, I'd be a phony if I let them stick me in a movie short. She was a funny girl, old Jane. I wouldn't exactly describe her as strictly beautiful. She knocked me out, though. She was sort of muckle-mouthed. I mean when she was
talking and she got excited about something, her mouth sort of went in about fifty
directions, her lips and all. That killed me. And she never really closed it all the way, her
mouth. It was always just a little bit open, especially when she got in her golf stance, or
when she was reading a book. She was always reading, and she read very good books. She read a lot of poetry and all. She was the only one, outside my family, that I ever
showed Allie's baseball mitt to, with all the poems written on it. She'd never met Allie or
anything, because that was her first summer in Maine--before that, she went to Cape Cod-
-but I told her quite a lot about him. She was interested in that kind of stuff. My mother didn't like her too much. I mean my mother always thought Jane and
her mother were sort of snubbing her or something when they didn't say hello. My
mother saw them in the village a lot, because Jane used to drive to market with her
mother in this LaSalle convertible they had. My mother didn't think Jane was pretty,
even. I did, though. I just liked the way she looked, that's all. I remember this one afternoon. It was the only time old Jane and I ever got close
to necking, even. It was a Saturday and it was raining like a bastard out, and I was over at
her house, on the porch--they had this big screened-in porch. We were playing checkers. I
used to kid her once in a while because she wouldn't take her kings out of the back row. But I didn't kid her much, though. You never wanted to kid Jane too much. I think I really
like it best when you can kid the pants off a girl when the opportunity arises, but it's a
funny thing. The girls I like best are the ones I never feel much like kidding. Sometimes I
think they'd like it if you kidded them--in fact, I know they would--but it's hard to get
started, once you've known them a pretty long time and never kidded them. Anyway, I
was telling you about that afternoon Jane and I came close to necking. It was raining like
hell and we were out on her porch, and all of a sudden this booze hound her mother was
married to came out on the porch and asked Jane if there were any cigarettes in the house. I didn't know him too well or anything, but he looked like the kind of guy that wouldn't
talk to you much unless he wanted something off you. He had a lousy personality. Anyway, old Jane wouldn't answer him when he asked her if she knew where there was
any cigarettes. So the guy asked her again, but she still wouldn't answer him. She didn't
even look up from the game. Finally the guy went inside the house. When he did, I asked
Jane what the hell was going on. She wouldn't even answer me, then. She made out like
she was concentrating on her next move in the game and all. Then all of a sudden, this
tear plopped down on the checkerboard. On one of the red squares--boy, I can still see it. She just rubbed it into the board with her finger. I don't know why, but it bothered hell
out of me. So what I did was, I went over and made her move over on the glider so that I
could sit down next to her--I practically sat down in her lap, as a matter of fact. Then she
really started to cry, and the next thing I knew, I was kissing her all over--anywhere--her
eyes, her nose, her forehead, her eyebrows and all, her ears--her whole face except her
mouth and all. She sort of wouldn't let me get to her mouth. Anyway, it was the closest
we ever got to necking. After a while, she got up and went in and put on this red and
white sweater she had, that knocked me out, and we went to a goddam movie. I asked
her, on the way, if Mr. Cudahy--that was the booze hound's name--had ever tried to get
wise with her.

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
우리 엄마는 걔를 그렇게 좋아하지 않았어. 내 말은, 엄마는 제인이랑 제인 엄마가 인사 안 하면 자기들을 무시한다고 생각하거나 그랬어. 우리 엄마는 마을에서 걔네를 자주 봤어. 제인이 엄마랑 같이 그 라살 컨버터블 타고 장 보러 다니곤 했거든. 우리 엄마는 심지어 제인이 예쁘다고 생각하지도 않았어. 난 그랬지만 말이야. 난 그냥 걔 생긴 게 좋았을 뿐이야, 그게 다야.

이런 어느 날 오후가 기억나. 늙은 제인이랑 내가 키스할 뻔했던 유일한 때였어. 그날은 토요일이었고 밖에 비가 미친 듯이 쏟아지고 있었어. 나는 걔네 집 테라스에 있었는데—걔네는 망이 쳐진 넓은 테라스가 있었거든. 우리는 체커를 하고 있었어. 걔가 킹들을 뒷줄에서 안 빼는 바람에 가끔 놀리곤 했어. 그래도 걔를 그렇게 많이 놀리진 않았지. 제인을 너무 심하게 놀리면 안 됐거든. 내 생각엔 기회가 생기면 여자애를 아주 제대로 놀려댈 수 있는 게 최고로 좋은데, 이게 좀 웃기는 게 말이야. 내가 제일 좋아하는 여자애들은 내가 별로 놀리고 싶지 않은 애들이거든. 가끔은 걔네가 놀림받는 걸 좋아할 거라고 생각하기도 해—사실은 그럴 거라는 걸 나도 알지만—꽤 오랫동안 알고 지냈으면서 한 번도 놀린 적이 없으면 시작하기가 어렵거든. 어쨌든, 제인이랑 내가 키스할 뻔했던 그날 오후 얘기를 계속하고 있었지. 비가 억수같이 쏟아지고 있었고 우리는 걔네 테라스에 있었는데, 갑자기 걔네 엄마랑 결혼한 그 술고래가 테라스로 나오더니 제인한테 집에 담배 있냐고 물어봤어. 나는 걔를 잘 아는 건 아니었지만, 뭔가 얻어낼 게 없으면 별로 말도 안 걸 것 같은 타입으로 보였어. 성격이 개차반이었지. 어쨌든, 늙은 제인이 걔가 담배 어디 있는지 아냐고 물어봤는데도 대답을 안 하는 거야. 그래서 그 아저씨가 다시 물어봤는데도, 걔는 여전히 대답을 안 했어. 게임에서 눈도 안 떼고 있었지. 결국 그 아저씨는 집 안으로 들어갔어. 걔가 들어가자마자 나는 제인한테 대체 뭐가 어떻게 돌아가는 거냐고 물어봤어. 그때도 걔는 나한테 대답조차 안 하는 거야. 걔는 마치 게임 다음 수를 두는 데 집중하는 척했어. 그러더니 갑자기 체커판 위에 눈물 한 방울이 뚝 떨어지는 거야. 빨간 칸 중 하나에—야, 아직도 눈에 선해. 걔는 그냥 손가락으로 그걸 보드에 문질러 없앴어. 왜 그랬는지는 모르겠는데, 그게 나를 환장하게 신경 쓰이게 만들었어. 그래서 내가 어떻게 했냐면, 가서 그네 의자에서 비키라고 해서 걔 옆에 앉았어—사실상 걔 무릎에 앉다시피 했지. 그러자 걔가 진짜 울기 시작했고, 정신 차려 보니까 나는 걔 온몸에 키스하고 있었어—아무 데나 말이야—눈, 코, 이마, 눈썹이며 뭐며, 귀까지—입 빼고 얼굴 전체에 다 말이야. 걔는 입에는 못 오게 하는 것 같았어. 어쨌든, 그게 우리가 키스까지 갈 뻔했던 것 중 가장 가까웠던 때였어. 잠시 후, 걔가 일어나서 안으로 들어가서는 자기가 가지고 있던 그 빨간색 흰색 스웨터를 입었는데, 그게 나를 완전히 뿅 가게 했어. 그리고 우리는 빌어먹을 영화를 보러 갔지. 가는 길에 걔한테 물어봤어. 쿠다히 씨—그 술고래 이름이 그거였거든—가 혹시 걔한테 찝쩍거린 적이 있냐고.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration adopts the highly informal, colloquial, and personal voice of a cynical, observant, and often exasperated teenager (Holden Caulfield). It reads like an internal monologue or a direct address to a close confidant, characterized by a stream-of-consciousness feel. The tone is raw, unpolished, and intensely subjective, reflecting Holden's direct, unfiltered thoughts and judgments rather than a formal literary style.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **내적 독백 (Internal Monologue) / 의식의 흐름 (Stream of Consciousness):** The narrator's direct thoughts, feelings, and cynical observations are constantly revealed. Translate these as direct, unfiltered expressions.
    *   **구어체 (Colloquialism) 및 속어 (Slang):** Frequent use of informal language, including mild expletives (e.g., "damn," "goddam," "crap," "for Chrissake"). These should be rendered using appropriate Korean colloquialisms and mild exclamations that convey the original's casual, slightly rebellious, and often exasperated tone without being overly harsh or unnatural.
    *   **과장법 (Hyperbole) 및 냉소 (Cynicism) / 비꼬는 어조 (Sarcasm):** Exaggerations (e.g., "You would've puked") and a consistently cynical, judgmental perspective on people and situations (e.g., "prep school jerks," "morons"). Maintain this critical and often dismissive undertone.
    *   **반복 (Repetition):** Phrases like "for Chrissake," "and all," "goddam" are frequently repeated. Preserve this repetition where natural in Korean to maintain the original's conversational, almost obsessive rhythm.
    *   **직설적이고 비판적인 어조 (Direct and Critical Tone):** Holden directly expresses his dislikes and judgments. This frankness should be preserved.
*   **Recommended Speech Style for Narration:** Primarily use **해체 (반말체)** for the narrator's voice. This choice best reflects Holden's informal, personal, and unfiltered internal monologue and observations, creating a strong sense of intimacy and directness with the reader. Ensure the **해체** feels natural for a teenager's thought process, incorporating the colloquialisms and cynical tone.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Narrator (Holden Caulfield)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Horwitz (the taxi driver)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Holden is a teenager interacting with an adult, but he maintains his characteristic informal and often slightly defensive or argumentative demeanor. He is initially trying to de-escalate, then clarify his point, then challenges Horwitz's logic. He eventually gives up on the argument due to Horwitz's stubbornness, and attempts to shift the topic or make friendly conversation. His tone can range from slightly exasperated to curious, to defeated, and finally to a casual attempt at politeness.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use **해요체** as the primary speech level. This reflects Holden's informal yet not overly intimate or rude address to an adult.
        *   When trying to de-escalate or clarify ("Who's sore?", "The fish—that's different."), use a polite but firm **해요체**.
        *   When questioning or challenging Horwitz's logic ("What do they do, the fish and all?", "They can't just ignore the ice."), maintain a questioning **해요체**, possibly with an implied tone of frustration.
        *   When giving up or expressing defeat ("Oh."), a simple, short **해체** is appropriate.
        *   When attempting to be friendly or shift topics ("Would you care to stop off..."), use a slightly more careful or polite **해요체**.
        *   When answering directly and concisely ("I'm not tired."), use a straightforward **해요체**.
        *   When cut off ("No, but--"), use an unfinished **해요체** ending.

*   **Character: Horwitz**
    *   **Speaking to:** Narrator (Holden Caulfield)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Horwitz is an older, gruff, and easily agitated taxi driver. He speaks informally, often aggressively, and with strong conviction about his (often flawed) ideas. He frequently sounds "sore" or exasperated, and is condescending towards Holden, viewing him as naive. He uses expletives and dismissive language. His speech is characterized by stubbornness, anger, and a commanding tone.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Primarily use **해라체**. This choice accurately conveys his age, social standing relative to Holden, and his gruff, commanding, and often condescending manner.
        *   When asserting his views or stating facts ("The fish don't go no place. They stay right where they are."), use a declarative, blunt **해라체**.
        *   When expressing exasperation, anger, or condescension ("What's different about it? Nothin's different about it!", "Use your head, for Chrissake," "What the hellaya mean what do they do?"), use an agitated, strong, and sometimes yelling **해라체**.
        *   When defending his points passionately or explaining his "nature" theories ("They live right in the goddam ice. It's their nature..."), use a forceful and decisive **해라체**.
        *   When insulting or questioning Holden's age/intelligence ("What'sa matter with ya?", "How the hell old are you, anyways? Why ain'tcha home in bed?"), use a clearly dismissive and rude **해라체**.
        *   When dismissing Holden's offer ("I ain't got no time for no liquor, bud"), use a direct, informal **해라체**.
        *   Maintain the use of expletives ("goddam," "for Chrissake") with appropriate Korean equivalents that convey the same level of irritation and informality.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
She was pretty young, but she had this terrific figure, and I wouldn't've put
it past that Cudahy bastard. She said no, though. I never did find out what the hell was the
matter. Some girls you practically never find out what's the matter. I don't want you to get the idea she was a goddam icicle or something, just
because we never necked or horsed around much. She wasn't. I held hands with her all
the time, for instance. That doesn't sound like much, I realize, but she was terrific to hold
hands with. Most girls if you hold hands with them, their goddam hand dies on you, or
else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the time, as if they were afraid
they'd bore you or something. Jane was different. We'd get into a goddam movie or
something, and right away we'd start holding hands, and we wouldn't quit till the movie
was over. And without changing the position or making a big deal out of it. You never
even worried, with Jane, whether your hand was sweaty or not. All you knew was, you
were happy. You really were. One other thing I just thought of. One time, in this movie, Jane did something that
just about knocked me out. The newsreel was on or something, and all of a sudden I felt
this hand on the back of my neck, and it was Jane's. It was a funny thing to do. I mean
she was quite young and all, and most girls if you see them putting their hand on the back
of somebody's neck, they're around twenty-five or thirty and usually they're doing it to
their husband or their little kid--I do it to my kid sister Phoebe once in a while, for
instance. But if a girl's quite young and all and she does it, it's so pretty it just about kills
you. Anyway, that's what I was thinking about while I sat in that vomity-looking chair
in the lobby. Old Jane. Every time I got to the part about her out with Stradlater in that
damn Ed Banky's car, it almost drove me crazy. I knew she wouldn't let him get to first
base with her, but it drove me crazy anyway. I don't even like to talk about it, if you want
to know the truth. There was hardly anybody in the lobby any more. Even all the whory-looking
blondes weren't around any more, and all of a sudden I felt like getting the hell out of the
place. It was too depressing. And I wasn't tired or anything. So I went up to my room and
put on my coat. I also took a look out the window to see if all the perverts were still in
action, but the lights and all were out now. I went down in the elevator again and got a
cab and told the driver to take me down to Ernie's. Ernie's is this night club in Greenwich
Village that my brother D.B. used to go to quite frequently before he went out to
Hollywood and prostituted himself. He used to take me with him once in a while. Ernie's
a big fat colored guy that plays the piano. He's a terrific snob and he won't hardly even
talk to you unless you're a big shot or a celebrity or something, but he can really play the
piano. He's so good he's almost corny, in fact. I don't exactly know what I mean by that,
but I mean it. I certainly like to hear him play, but sometimes you feel like turning his
goddam piano over. I think it's because sometimes when he plays, he sounds like the kind
of guy that won't talk to you unless you're a big shot. 12
 The cab I had was a real old one that smelled like someone'd just tossed his
cookies in it. I always get those vomity kind of cabs if I go anywhere late at night. What
made it worse, it was so quiet and lonesome out, even though it was Saturday night. I
didn't see hardly anybody on the street. Now and then you just saw a man and a girl
crossing a street, with their arms around each other's waists and all, or a bunch of
hoodlumy-looking guys and their dates, all of them laughing like hyenas at something
you could bet wasn't funny. New York's terrible when somebody laughs on the street very
late at night. You can hear it for miles. It makes you feel so lonesome and depressed. I
kept wishing I could go home and shoot the bull for a while with old Phoebe. But finally,
after I was riding a while, the cab driver and I sort of struck up a conversation. His name
was Horwitz. He was a much better guy than the other driver I'd had. Anyway, I thought
maybe he might know about the ducks. "Hey, Horwitz," I said. "You ever pass by the lagoon in Central Park? Down by
Central Park South?"
 "The what?"
 "The lagoon. That little lake, like, there. Where the ducks are. You know."
 "Yeah, what about it?"
 "Well, you know the ducks that swim around in it? In the springtime and all? Do
you happen to know where they go in the wintertime, by any chance?"
 "Where who goes?"
 "The ducks. Do you know, by any chance? I mean does somebody come around
in a truck or something and take them away, or do they fly away by themselves--go south
or something?"
 Old Horwitz turned all the way around and looked at me. He was a very
impatient-type guy. He wasn't a bad guy, though. "How the hell should I know?" he said. "How the hell should I know a stupid thing like that?"
 "Well, don't get sore about it," I said. He was sore about it or something.

내가 탄 택시는 누가 방금 토를 한 것 같은 냄새가 나는 진짜 오래된 거였어. 난 밤늦게 어딜 가든 항상 토 냄새 나는 택시를 탄다니까. 더 안 좋았던 건, 토요일 밤이었는데도 밖이 너무 조용하고 쓸쓸했다는 거야. 길에는 거의 아무도 보이지 않았어. 가끔씩은 그냥 길을 건너는 남자랑 여자애가 서로 허리를 감싸 안고 있거나, 아니면 불량배처럼 생긴 남자애들이랑 그 애인들이 무리 지어 다니면서, 재미도 없을 게 분명한 일에 하이에나처럼 웃어대는 게 보였을 뿐이야. 뉴욕은 아주 늦은 밤에 누가 길에서 웃어대면 정말 끔찍해. 몇 마일 밖에서도 들린다니까. 너무 쓸쓸하고 우울하게 만든다니까. 난 집에 가서 피비랑 실없는 수다라도 좀 떨 수 있었으면 하고 계속 바랐어. 그런데 한참을 달리다 보니, 결국 택시 운전사랑 나랑 대화를 시작하게 됐어. 이름은 호위츠였어. 그는 내가 탔던 다른 운전사보다 훨씬 나은 사람이었어. 어쨌든, 난 혹시 그가 오리에 대해 알지도 모른다고 생각했지.

"이봐요, 호위츠 씨," 내가 말했어. "센트럴 파크에 있는 석호 지나가 본 적 있으세요? 센트럴 파크 사우스 아래쪽에요?"
"뭐요?"
"석호요. 거기 있는 작은 호수 같은 거요. 오리들이 있는 데요. 아시죠?"
"네, 근데요?"
"음, 거기서 헤엄쳐 다니는 오리들 있잖아요? 봄 같은 때에요? 혹시 겨울에는 어디로 가는지 아세요?"
"누가 어디로 가냐고요?"
"오리들이요. 혹시 아세요? 제 말은 누가 트럭 같은 걸로 와서 걔네를 데려가는지, 아니면 자기들끼리 날아가 버리는지—남쪽으로 가거나 그러는지 말이에요?"
호위츠 아저씨는 완전히 몸을 돌려 나를 쳐다봤어. 그는 아주 성질 급한 타입의 사람이었어. 나쁜 사람은 아니었지만 말이야.
"내가 그걸 어떻게 알아요?" 그가 말했어. "내가 그런 바보 같은 걸 어떻게 아냐고요?"
"음, 화내지 마세요." 내가 말했어. 그가 그 일 때문에 화가 났거나 그랬어.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is highly informal, colloquial, cynical, and judgmental. It adopts a direct, stream-of-consciousness style, characteristic of a jaded teenager speaking candidly to an implied listener. It is distinctly **구어체 (Gueo-che - spoken style)**, rather than formal **문어체 (Mun-eo-che - written style)**, reflecting an unrefined, rambling, and personal monologue. The tone is often world-weary and critical of others.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Internal Monologue/Stream of Consciousness:** The narrator's unfiltered thoughts, opinions, and observations are directly presented, often veering off-topic with interjections. This should be preserved by using flexible, informal sentence structures.
    *   **Colloquialism/Slang:** Frequent use of informal, sometimes crude, language ("bastards," "goddam," "jerks," "dope fiend"). Appropriate Korean equivalents that convey similar levels of informality and mild offensiveness should be sought.
    *   **Direct Address to Reader:** The narrator frequently addresses the reader directly ("If you were only around six years old...", "Imagine giving somebody..."), creating an intimate, conversational rapport.
    *   **Hyperbole:** Exaggeration for effect ("They killed me," "break around forty of your fingers").
    *   **Cynicism and Sarcasm:** A pervasive undercurrent of disdain and critical observation towards people and situations.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden Caulfield (Narrator's Voice)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Implicitly the reader, but primarily internal monologue.
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Cynical, jaded, judgmental, often bored or annoyed, expressing strong opinions and dislikes. The voice is that of a disaffected teenager.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** A flexible mix to capture the nuances:
        *   For general observations, judgments, and declarative statements about the world: Use **해라체 (Haera-che)** to convey his bluntness and perceived authority/world-weariness.
        *   For more direct addresses or rhetorical questions posed to the reader: **해요체 (Haeyo-che)** can be effective to maintain a conversational, direct tone.
        *   For raw, immediate thoughts, exclamations, or highly informal asides: **해체 (Hae-che)** should be used, reflecting the stream-of-consciousness and intimacy of his internal world.
        *   Maintain the **구어체 (Gueo-che)** feel throughout, avoiding overly formal or literary phrasing.

*   **Character: Holden Caulfield (Dialogue)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Lillian Simmons
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Reluctant, apathetic, minimally polite but clearly uninterested in prolonging the conversation.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use **해요체 (Haeyo-che)**. This choice reflects a basic level of politeness towards an acquaintance (his brother's ex-girlfriend) whom he has no particular affection for, while also conveying his lack of enthusiasm through short, non-committal answers.

*   **Character: Terrific-looking girl**
    *   **Speaking to:** Joe Yale-looking guy (her date)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Slightly tipsy ("crocked"), uncomfortable with her date's public advances, attempting to maintain decorum while also reacting to the disturbing story he's telling. Her protests are somewhat subdued.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Use **해요체 (Haeyo-che)**. Her "How horrible" is a polite, slightly detached reaction. Her protests ("Don't, darling. Please, don't. Not here.") should convey a soft, intimate yet still polite and somewhat embarrassed refusal, appropriate for a couple in a public setting. The "darling" (자기 or 여보) can be rendered appropriately for an intimate but still public-aware tone.

*   **Character: Lillian Simmons**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden Caulfield
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Overly enthusiastic, superficial, "phony," primarily interested in D.B.'s celebrity status. Her expressions are exaggerated and insincere.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** An overly effusive and somewhat artificial **해요체 (Haeyo-che)**. Her exclamations ("How marvelous!", "How exciting!") should sound exaggerated and lacking genuine emotion. The use of "baby" at the end is overly familiar and slightly patronizing for Holden. The translation should convey an affected, perhaps overly bright or forced, tone to match her "phony" description.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
"Who's sore? Nobody's sore."
 I stopped having a conversation with him, if he was going to get so damn touchy
about it. But he started it up again himself. He turned all the way around again, and said,
"The fish don't go no place. They stay right where they are, the fish. Right in the goddam
lake."
 "The fish--that's different. The fish is different. I'm talking about the ducks," I
said. "What's different about it? Nothin's different about it," Horwitz said. Everything
he said, he sounded sore about something. "It's tougher for the fish, the winter and all,
than it is for the ducks, for Chrissake. Use your head, for Chrissake."
 I didn't say anything for about a minute. Then I said, "All right. What do they do,
the fish and all, when that whole little lake's a solid block of ice, people skating on it and
all?"
 Old Horwitz turned around again. "What the hellaya mean what do they do?" he
yelled at me. "They stay right where they are, for Chrissake."
 "They can't just ignore the ice. They can't just ignore it."
 "Who's ignoring it? Nobody's ignoring it!" Horwitz said. He got so damn excited
and all, I was afraid he was going to drive the cab right into a lamppost or something. "They live right in the goddam ice. It's their nature, for Chrissake. They get frozen right
in one position for the whole winter."
 "Yeah? What do they eat, then? I mean if they're frozen solid, they can't swim
around looking for food and all."
 "Their bodies, for Chrissake--what'sa matter with ya? Their bodies take in
nutrition and all, right through the goddam seaweed and crap that's in the ice. They got
their pores open the whole time. That's their nature, for Chrissake. See what I mean?" He
turned way the hell around again to look at me. "Oh," I said. I let it drop. I was afraid he was going to crack the damn taxi up or
something. Besides, he was such a touchy guy, it wasn't any pleasure discussing anything
with him. "Would you care to stop off and have a drink with me somewhere?" I said. He didn't answer me, though. I guess he was still thinking. I asked him again,
though. He was a pretty good guy. Quite amusing and all. "I ain't got no time for no liquor, bud," he said. "How the hell old are you,
anyways? Why ain'tcha home in bed?"
 "I'm not tired."
 When I got out in front of Ernie's and paid the fare, old Horwitz brought up the
fish again. He certainly had it on his mind. "Listen," he said. "If you was a fish, Mother
Nature'd take care of you, wouldn't she? Right? You don't think them fish just die when it
gets to be winter, do ya?"
 "No, but--"
 "You're goddam right they don't," Horwitz said, and drove off like a bat out of
hell. He was about the touchiest guy I ever met. Everything you said made him sore. Even though it was so late, old Ernie's was jampacked. Mostly with prep school
jerks and college jerks. Almost every damn school in the world gets out earlier for
Christmas vacation than the schools I go to. You could hardly check your coat, it was so
crowded. It was pretty quiet, though, because Ernie was playing the piano. It was
supposed to be something holy, for God's sake, when he sat down at the piano. Nobody's
that good. About three couples, besides me, were waiting for tables, and they were all
shoving and standing on tiptoes to get a look at old Ernie while he played. He had a big
damn mirror in front of the piano, with this big spotlight on him, so that everybody could
watch his face while he played. You couldn't see his fingers while he played--just his big
old face. Big deal. I'm not too sure what the name of the song was that he was playing
when I came in, but whatever it was, he was really stinking it up. He was putting all these
dumb, show-offy ripples in the high notes, and a lot of other very tricky stuff that gives
me a pain in the ass. You should've heard the crowd, though, when he was finished. You
would've puked. They went mad. They were exactly the same morons that laugh like
hyenas in the movies at stuff that isn't funny. I swear to God, if I were a piano player or
an actor or something and all those dopes thought I was terrific, I'd hate it. I wouldn't
even want them to clap for me. People always clap for the wrong things. If I were a piano
player, I'd play it in the goddam closet. Anyway, when he was finished, and everybody
was clapping their heads off, old Ernie turned around on his stool and gave this very
phony, humble bow. Like as if he was a helluva humble guy, besides being a terrific
piano player. It was very phony--I mean him being such a big snob and all. In a funny
way, though, I felt sort of sorry for him when he was finished. I don't even think he
knows any more when he's playing right or not. It isn't all his fault. I partly blame all
those dopes that clap their heads off--they'd foul up anybody, if you gave them a chance. Anyway, it made me feel depressed and lousy again, and I damn near got my coat back
and went back to the hotel, but it was too early and I didn't feel much like being all alone. They finally got me this stinking table, right up against a wall and behind a
goddam post, where you couldn't see anything.

"젠장할 정도로 안 죽어." 호르위츠가 말하더니 미친 듯이 쌩하고 가버렸어. 그는 내가 만난 사람 중에 제일 예민한 사람이었어. 내가 무슨 말을 하든 그를 화나게 만들었지.

그렇게 늦은 시간인데도 어니스에는 발 디딜 틈 없이 사람이 꽉 차 있었어. 대부분은 예비학교 멍청이들이랑 대학 멍청이들이었어. 내가 다니는 학교들보다 빌어먹을 세상 거의 모든 학교가 크리스마스 방학을 더 일찍 하더라고. 너무 붐벼서 코트를 맡길 데도 거의 없었어. 어니가 피아노를 치고 있어서 꽤 조용했지만 말이야. 그가 피아노에 앉으면 세상에나, 뭔가 성스러운 것이라도 되는 양 그랬어. 그 정도로 잘하는 사람은 없어. 나 말고 한 세 쌍 정도가 테이블을 기다리고 있었는데, 다들 어니 아저씨가 연주하는 걸 보려고 서로 밀치며 발꿈치를 들고 서 있었어. 그는 피아노 앞에 빌어먹을 커다란 거울을 놓고 자기한테 커다란 스포트라이트를 비춰서 사람들이 연주하는 동안 자기 얼굴을 다 볼 수 있게 했어. 연주할 때는 손가락은 안 보이고 그냥 그 커다란 늙은 얼굴만 보였어. 대단한 일도 아니지. 내가 들어갔을 때 그가 치던 곡이 뭔지는 잘 모르겠지만, 뭐였든 간에 그는 정말 그걸 엉망으로 만들고 있었어. 고음 부분에 멍청하고 잘난 체하는 기교를 잔뜩 넣고, 그 외에도 나를 정말 골치 아프게 하는 온갖 교묘한 짓거리를 하고 있었어. 근데 그가 연주를 끝냈을 때 관중들 소리를 들었어야 했어. 토할 뻔했을 거야. 미쳐 날뛰었어. 재미도 없는 일에 영화관에서 하이에나처럼 웃어대는 딱 그 얼간이들이었어. 맹세컨대, 내가 피아노 연주자나 배우 같은 거라서 그 멍청이들이 날 대단하다고 생각한다면, 난 그게 정말 싫을 거야. 박수조차 치지 않았으면 좋겠어. 사람들은 항상 엉뚱한 것에 박수를 친다니까. 내가 피아노 연주자라면 빌어먹을 벽장 안에서 연주할 거야. 하여튼, 그가 연주를 마치고 모두가 미친 듯이 박수치고 있을 때, 어니 아저씨는 의자에서 몸을 돌려 아주 가식적이고 겸손한 인사를 했어. 대단한 피아노 연주자인 것 외에도 엄청 겸손한 사람인 양 말이야. 아주 가식적이었어—내 말은 그가 그렇게 대단한 속물인데도 말이야. 이상하게도, 그가 연주를 마쳤을 때 왠지 모르게 그가 안쓰러웠어. 이제는 그가 제대로 연주하는지 아닌지도 모르는 것 같아. 전적으로 그의 잘못은 아니야. 나는 부분적으로는 미친 듯이 박수치는 그 멍청이들 탓이라고 생각해—기회를 주면 누구든 망쳐놓을 거야. 하여튼, 또 우울하고 비참해져서 거의 코트를 다시 찾아 호텔로 돌아갈 뻔했지만, 너무 이른 시간이었고 혼자 있는 게 별로 내키지 않았어. 결국 그들은 나한테 벽에 딱 붙어 빌어먹을 기둥 뒤에 있어서 아무것도 볼 수 없는 빌어먹을 테이블을 줬어.

Key Term Translations:
Caulfield: 콜필드
Ernie: 어니
Lillian Simmons: 릴리안 시몬스
Pencey: 펜시

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** 이 지문은 홀든 콜필드의 1인칭 시점으로 서술되며, 매우 사적이고 비공식적이며, 구어적인(spoken) 독백의 형태를 띱니다. 냉소적이고, 세상에 대한 불만과 염세주의를 드러내면서도, 동시에 자신의 나약함과 유약함("yellow guy")을 인정하는 자조적인 면모를 보여줍니다. 젊은 화자의 다소 거칠고 비속어("goddam," "damn") 사용이 잦으며, 생각의 흐름이 자유롭게 이어지는 의식의 흐름 기법이 두드러집니다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **의식의 흐름 (Stream of Consciousness):** 한 생각에서 다른 생각으로 자유롭게 넘어가며, 내면의 생각과 감정, 관찰이 비선형적으로 이어집니다.
    *   **냉소주의와 풍자 (Cynicism & Satire):** 세상과 타인에 대한 회의적이고 비판적인 시각, 특히 위선적인 면모를 꼬집는 태도가 드러납니다.
    *   **과장법 (Hyperbole):** 감정이나 상황을 극대화하여 표현하는 경향이 있습니다 ("kills me," "bored to death").
    *   **자조 (Self-deprecation):** 자신의 나약함이나 단점을 솔직하게 인정하며 비하하는 모습이 나타납니다.
    *   **구어체적 표현 (Colloquialisms):** "stuff," "stick around," "get this straight" 등 일상 회화에 사용되는 표현이 많습니다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: 홀든 콜필드 (Holden Caulfield) - 내레이션 및 내면 독백**
    *   **Speaking to:** 자기 자신 (내면 독백), 암묵적으로 독자
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 세상에 대한 불만, 냉소, 자조, 좌절감, 때로는 분노, 자신의 나약함에 대한 고백. 생각의 흐름을 따라가는 자유롭고 비공식적인 어조.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 홀든의 독특한 개성과 내면을 효과적으로 전달하기 위해, **해체 (비격식체, 반말)**를 주된 서술 방식으로 사용합니다. 이는 독자와의 친밀감을 형성하고, 홀든의 사적이고 솔직하며 자유로운 사고방식을 가장 잘 반영할 수 있습니다.
        *   **핵심:** 지나치게 공손한 어미(-어요/-아요)나 딱딱한 평서체 어미(-다)를 피하고, 마치 홀든이 혼잣말을 하듯, 혹은 아주 가까운 친구에게 이야기하듯 자연스러운 **해체** 어미(-어/아, -지, -을걸, -았지 등)를 일관되게 사용합니다.
        *   강한 감정이나 단정적인 판단("Which always kills me." "People are always ruining things for you.")의 경우, 간혹 **해라체**(-다)를 섞어 사용하여 어조의 변화를 줄 수 있으나, 전반적인 내러티브의 흐름은 **해체**를 유지하는 것이 좋습니다.

*   **Character: 홀든 콜필드 (Holden Caulfield) - 가상의 대화 (도둑과의 상황)**
    *   **Speaking to:** 가상의 '도둑'
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 용기를 내어 상대에게 맞서려 하지만, 실제로는 겁을 먹고 제대로 대응하지 못하는 '유약함(yellow)'이 드러나는 상황. 겉으로는 강한 척 하지만 내면은 갈등하고 불안해하는 모습. 비꼬는 듯한 어조.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 상대방에게 직접적으로 말을 거는 상황이므로 **해라체 (반말)**를 사용합니다. 하지만 단순히 딱딱한 **해라체**가 아니라, 홀든의 내면적 나약함이 투영되어 위협적이지 못하고, 오히려 비꼬거나 주저하는 듯한 뉘앙스를 담아냅니다.
        *   예: "Okay. How 'bout handing over those gloves?" → "어이, 장갑 좀 내놔보는 게 어때?" (해라체이되, 직접적이지 않은 뉘앙스)
        *   "I suppose these are your goddam gloves?" → "이게 네 빌어먹을 장갑이라는 거겠지?" (비꼬는 해라체)
        *   "All I know is my goddam gloves were in your goddam galoshes." → "난 그냥 내 빌어먹을 장갑이 네 빌어먹을 장갑 속에 있었다는 것만 알아." (회피성 해라체)

*   **Character: 가상의 '도둑' (Hypothetical "Crook")**
    *   **Speaking to:** 홀든 콜필드
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 자신의 죄를 부인하며 능청스럽게 연기하거나, 홀든을 무시하고 역으로 비난하는 듯한 태도. 처음에는 순진한 척 가장하고, 나중에는 홀든을 도발하거나 무시하는 어조.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** 상대방에게 말을 거는 상황이므로 **해라체 (반말)**를 사용합니다. 다만, 문맥에 따라 어조를 조절합니다.
        *   **초기 '순진한 척':** "What gloves?" → "무슨 장갑?" (능청스럽고 순진한 척하는 해라체)
        *   **부정 및 무시:** "I never saw those gloves before in my life. If they're yours, take 'em. I don't want the goddam things." → "난 살면서 그 장갑 본 적 없어. 네 거면 가져가. 그 빌어먹을 것들 필요 없어." (단호하고 무시하는 해라체)
        *   **역공:** "Listen, Caulfield. Are you calling me a crook?" 및 "Listen. Let's get this straight. Are you calling me a thief?" → "야, 콜필드. 지금 날 도둑이라고 부르는 거야?" 및 "야, 똑바로 말해 봐. 지금 날 도둑놈이라고 부르는 거냐고?" (도발적이고 추궁하는 해라체)

### Immediate Context Used (English):
It was one of those tiny little tables that if
the people at the next table don't get up to let you by--and they never do, the bastards--
you practically have to climb into your chair. I ordered a Scotch and soda, which is my
favorite drink, next to frozen Daiquiris. If you were only around six years old, you could
get liquor at Ernie's, the place was so dark and all, and besides, nobody cared how old
you were. You could even be a dope fiend and nobody'd care. I was surrounded by jerks. I'm not kidding. At this other tiny table, right to my
left, practically on top of me, there was this funny-looking guy and this funny-looking
girl. They were around my age, or maybe just a little older. It was funny. You could see
they were being careful as hell not to drink up the minimum too fast. I listened to their
conversation for a while, because I didn't have anything else to do. He was telling her
about some pro football game he'd seen that afternoon. He gave her every single goddam
play in the whole game--I'm not kidding. He was the most boring guy I ever listened to. And you could tell his date wasn't even interested in the goddam game, but she was even
funnier-looking than he was, so I guess she had to listen. Real ugly girls have it tough. I
feel so sorry for them sometimes. Sometimes I can't even look at them, especially if
they're with some dopey guy that's telling them all about a goddam football game. On my
right, the conversation was even worse, though. On my right there was this very Joe
Yale-looking guy, in a gray flannel suit and one of those flitty-looking Tattersall vests. All those Ivy League bastards look alike. My father wants me to go to Yale, or maybe
Princeton, but I swear, I wouldn't go to one of those Ivy League colleges, if I was dying,
for God's sake. Anyway, this Joe Yale-looking guy had a terrific-looking girl with him. Boy, she was good-looking. But you should've heard the conversation they were having. In the first place, they were both slightly crocked. What he was doing, he was giving her
a feel under the table, and at the same time telling her all about some guy in his dorm that
had eaten a whole bottle of aspirin and nearly committed suicide. His date kept saying to
him, "How horrible . . . Don't, darling. Please, don't. Not here." Imagine giving somebody
a feel and telling them about a guy committing suicide at the same time! They killed me. I certainly began to feel like a prize horse's ass, though, sitting there all by myself. There wasn't anything to do except smoke and drink. What I did do, though, I told the
waiter to ask old Ernie if he'd care to join me for a drink. I told him to tell him I was
D.B.'s brother. I don't think he ever even gave him my message, though. Those bastards
never give your message to anybody. All of a sudden, this girl came up to me and said, "Holden Caulfield!" Her name
was Lillian Simmons. My brother D.B. used to go around with her for a while. She had
very big knockers. "Hi," I said. I tried to get up, naturally, but it was some job getting up, in a place
like that. She had some Navy officer with her that looked like he had a poker up his ass. "How marvelous to see you!" old Lillian Simmons said. Strictly a phony. "How's
your big brother?" That's all she really wanted to know. "He's fine. He's in Hollywood."
 "In Hollywood! How marvelous! What's he doing?"
 "I don't know. Writing," I said. I didn't feel like discussing it. You could tell she
thought it was a big deal, his being in Hollywood. Almost everybody does. Mostly people
who've never read any of his stories. It drives me crazy, though. "How exciting," old Lillian said. Then she introduced me to the Navy guy. His
name was Commander Blop or something. He was one of those guys that think they're
being a pansy if they don't break around forty of your fingers when they shake hands with
you. God, I hate that stuff. "Are you all alone, baby?" old Lillian asked me. She was
blocking up the whole goddam traffic in the aisle. You could tell she liked to block up a
lot of traffic. This waiter was waiting for her to move out of the way, but she didn't even
notice him. It was funny. You could tell the waiter didn't like her much, you could tell
even the Navy guy didn't like her much, even though he was dating her. And I didn't like
her much. Nobody did. You had to feel sort of sorry for her, in a way. "Don't you have a
date, baby?" she asked me. I was standing up now, and she didn't even tell me to sit
down. She was the type that keeps you standing up for hours. "Isn't he handsome?" she
said to the Navy guy. "Holden, you're getting handsomer by the minute." The Navy guy
told her to come on. He told her they were blocking up the whole aisle. "Holden, come
join us," old Lillian said. "Bring your drink."
 "I was just leaving," I told her. "I have to meet somebody." You could tell she was
just trying to get in good with me. So that I'd tell old D.B. about it. "Well, you little so-and-so. All right for you. Tell your big brother I hate him,
when you see him."
 Then she left. The Navy guy and I told each other we were glad to've met each
other.

"세상에, 만나서 정말 반갑네요!" 늙은 릴리안 시몬스가 말했어. 완전 가식적이었지. "형은 잘 지내요?" 그게 그녀가 정말 알고 싶었던 전부였어. "잘 지내요. 할리우드에 있어요." "할리우드에! 세상에나, 정말 멋져요! 뭐 하고 있어요?" "몰라요. 글 쓰고 있어요." 내가 말했어. 이야기하고 싶지 않았거든. 그녀는 형이 할리우드에 있다는 걸 대단하게 생각하는 게 분명했어. 거의 모든 사람이 그렇지. 주로 형의 소설을 한 번도 읽어본 적 없는 사람들이 말이야. 근데 난 그게 미치도록 싫어.

"정말 신나는 일이네요." 늙은 릴리안이 말했어. 그러고는 나를 그 해군 장교한테 소개해줬어. 이름이 사령관 블롭인가 뭔가 그랬어. 악수할 때 남의 손가락 한 마흔 개는 부러뜨릴 것 같이 꽉 잡지 않으면 계집애 같다고 생각하는 그런 놈들 중 하나였어. 제기랄, 난 그런 거 정말 싫어. "혼자 있어요, 아가?" 늙은 릴리안이 나한테 물었어. 그녀는 빌어먹을 복도 전체의 통행을 가로막고 있었어. 사람들의 통행을 가로막는 걸 좋아하는 게 분명했지. 웨이터가 그녀가 비켜주기를 기다리고 있었는데, 그녀는 눈치조차 못 채고 있었어. 웃겼어. 웨이터도 그녀를 별로 안 좋아하는 게 분명했고, 그녀랑 데이트 중인데도 해군 장교조차 그녀를 별로 안 좋아하는 게 분명했어. 그리고 나도 그녀를 별로 안 좋아했어. 아무도 안 좋아했지. 어떤 면에서는 좀 불쌍하게 여겨야만 했어. "데이트 상대는 없어요, 아가?" 그녀가 나한테 물었어. 나는 이제 서 있었는데, 그녀는 앉으라는 말조차 안 했어. 그녀는 사람을 몇 시간 동안 서 있게 만드는 타입이었어. "이 남자 잘생기지 않았어요?" 그녀가 해군 장교한테 말했어. "홀든, 갈수록 더 잘생겨지네요." 해군 장교는 그녀에게 어서 가자고 했어. 복도를 다 막고 있다고 말했지. "홀든, 이리 와서 우리랑 같이 앉아요." 늙은 릴리안이 말했어. "술 가져와요." "막 가려던 참이었어요." 내가 그녀한테 말했어. "누구 만날 사람이 있거든요." 그녀가 그냥 나한테 잘 보이려고 하는 게 분명했어. 그래서 내가 늙은 디비한테 얘기해 줄 거라고 생각했겠지. "흥, 이 망할 녀석 같으니. 잘났다, 잘났어. 네 형 보면 내가 그를 싫어한다고 전해줘." 그러더니 그녀는 가버렸어. 해군 장교랑 나는 서로 만나서 반갑다고 말했지.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** 비격식적이고 구어체적이며, 주관적인 의식의 흐름. 화자의 내면의 생각과 관찰이 여과 없이 드러나며, 냉소적이거나 우울한 기조를 띠지만 때로는 취약함과 순진함도 보인다. 마치 십대 청소년의 여과되지 않은 독백처럼 느껴져야 합니다.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **내적 독백 (Internal Monologue):** 전체 서술이 화자의 여과되지 않은 생각, 감정, 불안을 드러내는 내적 독백의 형태이므로 이를 일관되게 유지해야 합니다.
    *   **구어체 및 속어 (Colloquialisms and Slang):** 화자는 비격식적인 표현, 속어, 다소 비문법적인 구문("hardly didn't even show it")을 자주 사용합니다. 이는 현대 한국어의 자연스러운 구어체 표현으로 번역하여 유사한 수준의 비격식성과 진정성을 전달해야 하며, 한국어에서 부적절하게 들릴 수 있는 지나친 조어 또는 의도적인 비문법성을 피해야 합니다.
    *   **반복 및 과장 (Repetition and Exaggeration):** 화자는 요점을 강조하기 위해 구절을 반복하거나 과장하는 경향이 있습니다("It really did," "fifty million dead cigars"). 이러한 문체적 특성을 살려 화자의 감정 상태와 두서 없는 사고 과정을 전달해야 합니다.
    *   **직접적 독자 호명 (Direct Address):** 화자가 독자에게 직접 말을 거는 부분("If you want to know the truth")을 유지하여 제4의 벽을 깨는 효과를 살려야 합니다.
    *   **권장되는 서술체:** 일관되게 **해라체 (Haera-che)**를 사용합니다. 이는 마치 화자 자신이 독백을 하거나 매우 가까운 친구에게 털어놓는 듯한 비격식적이고 구어체적이며 직접적인 화자의 목소리를 가장 잘 반영합니다. 특별히 반어적인 효과를 노리는 경우가 아니라면 격식적이거나 지나치게 문어적인 표현은 피합니다.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Narrator (Holden)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Elevator Guy
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 처음에는 혼란스럽고 경계심을 보이며, 이내 당황하고 방어적이며, 우울함으로 인해 마지못해 동의하는 모습. 여자를 물어볼 때는 약간 긴장하며 통제력이나 선호도를 주장하려는 시도를 보입니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** **해요체 (Haeyo-che)**를 주로 사용합니다. 이는 낯선 사람과 중립적으로 소통하거나 다소 불편함을 느낄 때 가장 흔히 사용되는 공손-비격식체입니다. 그러나 "Me?"와 같이 진정으로 혼란스럽거나 당황하여 짧은 감탄사나 매우 간결한 답변을 할 때는 그의 젊음과 어색함을 나타내기 위해 다소 주저하거나 단축된 **해체 (Hae-che)**(비격식-비존대)를 사용할 수도 있습니다. 전반적인 낯선 사람과의 대화에서는 해요체를 유지하며, 그의 어색함, 젊음, 그리고 상대방과의 관계 설정(약간의 경계심과 동시에 마지못한 수용)을 드러냅니다.

*   **Character: Elevator Guy**
    *   **Speaking to:** Narrator (Holden)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** 노련하고 냉소적인 포주/알선업자. 직접적이고 강압적이며, 거래적이고 다소 깔보는 듯한 태도로 홀든을 순진한 대상으로 봅니다. 말투는 비즈니스적이지만 권위와 경험이 깔려 있습니다.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** **하게체 (Hage-che)**와 **해체 (Hae-che)**를 혼합하여 사용합니다. **하게체**는 나이가 많거나 아랫사람인 남성에게 다소 비격식적이면서도 권위적인 태도로 말할 때 적합하며(예: "How old are you, chief?"), 그의 나이와 경험을 전달합니다. **해체**는 매우 직설적인 질문이나 진술, 특히 돈에 대해 말하거나 지시를 내릴 때 사용하여 그의 거래적이고 무시하는 듯한 태도를 강조할 수 있습니다("Innarested in a little tail t'night?", "Her," "Let's go"). "chief"와 같은 호칭은 깔보는 듯한 친근감을 암시하므로, 어투와 특정 비격식 용어의 선택으로 이를 전달합니다.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
Which always kills me. I'm always saying "Glad to've met you" to somebody I'm
not at all glad I met. If you want to stay alive, you have to say that stuff, though. After I'd told her I had to meet somebody, I didn't have any goddam choice except
to leave. I couldn't even stick around to hear old Ernie play something halfway decent. But I certainly wasn't going to sit down at a table with old Lillian Simmons and that Navy
guy and be bored to death. So I left. It made me mad, though, when I was getting my
coat. People are always ruining things for you. 13
 I walked all the way back to the hotel. Forty-one gorgeous blocks. I didn't do it
because I felt like walking or anything. It was more because I didn't feel like getting in
and out of another taxicab. Sometimes you get tired of riding in taxicabs the same way
you get tired riding in elevators. All of a sudden, you have to walk, no matter how far or
how high up. When I was a kid, I used to walk all the way up to our apartment very
frequently. Twelve stories. You wouldn't even have known it had snowed at all. There was hardly any snow
on the sidewalks. But it was freezing cold, and I took my red hunting hat out of my
pocket and put it on--I didn't give a damn how I looked. I even put the earlaps down. I
wished I knew who'd swiped my gloves at Pencey, because my hands were freezing. Not
that I'd have done much about it even if I had known. I'm one of these very yellow guys. I
try not to show it, but I am. For instance, if I'd found out at Pencey who'd stolen my
gloves, I probably would've gone down to the crook's room and said, "Okay. How 'bout
handing over those gloves?" Then the crook that had stolen them probably would've said,
his voice very innocent and all, "What gloves?" Then what I probably would've done, I'd
have gone in his closet and found the gloves somewhere. Hidden in his goddam galoshes
or something, for instance. I'd have taken them out and showed them to the guy and said,
"I suppose these are your goddam gloves?" Then the crook probably would've given me
this very phony, innocent look, and said, "I never saw those gloves before in my life. If
they're yours, take 'em. I don't want the goddam things." Then I probably would've just
stood there for about five minutes. I'd have the damn gloves right in my hand and all, but
I'd feel I ought to sock the guy in the jaw or something--break his goddam jaw. Only, I
wouldn't have the guts to do it. I'd just stand there, trying to look tough. What I might do,
I might say something very cutting and snotty, to rile him up--instead of socking him in
the jaw. Anyway if I did say something very cutting and snotty, he'd probably get up and
come over to me and say, "Listen, Caulfield. Are you calling me a crook?" Then, instead
of saying, "You're goddam right I am, you dirty crooked bastard!" all I probably would've
said would be, "All I know is my goddam gloves were in your goddam galoshes." Right
away then, the guy would know for sure that I wasn't going to take a sock at him, and he
probably would've said, "Listen. Let's get this straight. Are you calling me a thief?" Then
I probably would've said, "Nobody's calling anybody a thief. All I know is my gloves
were in your goddam galoshes." It could go on like that for hours. Finally, though, I'd
leave his room without even taking a sock at him. I'd probably go down to the can and
sneak a cigarette and watch myself getting tough in the mirror. Anyway, that's what I
thought about the whole way back to the hotel. It's no fun to he yellow. Maybe I'm not all
yellow. I don't know. I think maybe I'm just partly yellow and partly the type that doesn't
give much of a damn if they lose their gloves. One of my troubles is, I never care too
much when I lose something--it used to drive my mother crazy when I was a kid. Some
guys spend days looking for something they lost. I never seem to have anything that if I
lost it I'd care too much. Maybe that's why I'm partly yellow. It's no excuse, though. It
really isn't. What you should be is not yellow at all. If you're supposed to sock somebody
in the jaw, and you sort of feel like doing it, you should do it. I'm just no good at it,
though. I'd rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock
him in the jaw. I hate fist fights. I don't mind getting hit so much--although I'm not crazy
about it, naturally--but what scares me most in a fist fight is the guy's face. I can't stand
looking at the other guy's face, is my trouble. It wouldn't be so bad if you could both be
blindfolded or something. It's a funny kind of yellowness, when you come to think of it,
but it's yellowness, all right. I'm not kidding myself. The more I thought about my gloves and my yellowness, the more depressed I
got, and I decided, while I was walking and all, to stop off and have a drink somewhere. I'd only had three drinks at Ernie's, and I didn't even finish the last one. One thing I have,
it's a terrific capacity. I can drink all night and not even show it, if I'm in the mood. Once,
at the Whooton School, this other boy, Raymond Goldfarb, and I bought a pint of Scotch
and drank it in the chapel one Saturday night, where nobody'd see us.

펜시에서 내 장갑을 훔쳐간 놈이 누군지 알았으면 좋겠다고 생각했어. 손이 꽁꽁 얼었거든. 솔직히 안다고 해도 딱히 뭘 했을 것 같지는 않지만 말이야. 난 아주 비겁한 놈들 중 하나거든. 티 내지 않으려 하지만, 사실 그래. 예를 들어, 펜시에서 내 장갑을 훔쳐간 놈이 누군지 알아냈다고 쳐봐. 아마 그 도둑놈 방으로 내려가서 이렇게 말했을 거야. "어이, 장갑 좀 내놔보는 게 어때?" 그럼 장갑을 훔친 그 도둑놈은 아주 순진한 목소리로 이렇게 말했겠지. "무슨 장갑?" 그럼 난 아마 그놈 옷장으로 들어가서 장갑을 어딘가에서 찾아냈을 거야. 예를 들면, 그 빌어먹을 장화 속에 숨겨져 있었겠지. 그걸 꺼내서 그놈한테 보여주며 말했을 거야. "이게 네 빌어먹을 장갑이라는 거겠지?" 그럼 그 도둑놈은 아마 아주 가식적이고 순진한 표정을 지으며 이렇게 말했을 거야. "난 살면서 그 장갑 본 적 없어. 네 거면 가져가. 그 빌어먹을 것들 필요 없어." 그럼 난 아마 한 5분 동안 그냥 서 있었을 거야. 빌어먹을 장갑을 손에 들고 있으면서도 그놈 턱이라도 한 대 갈겨야 하는데, 빌어먹을 턱을 부숴버려야 하는데 하는 생각이 들었겠지. 그런데 그럴 배짱은 없었을 거야. 그냥 tough 한 척 서 있었을 거라고. 내가 할 수 있는 건, 턱을 갈기는 대신, 그놈을 열 받게 하려고 아주 날카롭고 건방진 말을 했을 수도 있어. 아무튼 내가 아주 날카롭고 건방진 말을 했다면, 그놈은 아마 일어나서 내게 다가와 이렇게 말했겠지. "야, 콜필드. 지금 날 도둑이라고 부르는 거야?" 그럼 난 "그래, 빌어먹을, 맞아, 이 더러운 도둑놈아!"라고 말하는 대신, 아마 이렇게 말했을 거야. "난 그냥 내 빌어먹을 장갑이 네 빌어먹을 장화 속에 있었다는 것만 알아." 그럼 그놈은 바로 내가 한 대도 안 때릴 거라는 걸 확실히 알았을 거고, 아마 이렇게 말했겠지. "야. 똑바로 말해 봐. 지금 날 도둑놈이라고 부르는 거냐고?" 그럼 난 아마 "아무도 누구보고 도둑놈이라고 안 해. 난 그냥 내 장갑이 네 빌어먹을 장화 속에 있었다는 것만 알 뿐이야."라고 말했을 거야. 그런 식으로 몇 시간이고 계속될 수도 있었겠지. 결국, 난 그놈을 한 대도 때리지 않고 방을 나섰을 거야. 아마 화장실로 내려가서 담배 한 대 피우고 거울 속에서 스스로가 강해지는 모습을 지켜봤을 거야. 아무튼, 그게 호텔로 돌아오는 내내 내가 생각한 것들이야. 비겁한 건 전혀 재미없어. 어쩌면 내가 완전히 비겁한 건 아닐지도 몰라. 모르겠어. 어쩌면 난 부분적으로 비겁하고, 부분적으로는 장갑을 잃어버려도 별로 개의치 않는 타입인 것 같아. 내 문제점 중 하나는 뭘 잃어버려도 너무 신경 쓰지 않는다는 거야. 어렸을 땐 엄마를 미치게 했지. 어떤 놈들은 잃어버린 걸 찾으려고 며칠씩 허비해. 난 뭘 잃어버려도 너무 신경 쓸 만한 게 없는 것 같아. 어쩌면 그게 내가 부분적으로 비겁한 이유일지도 모르지. 그래도 변명은 안 돼. 정말 아니야. 절대 비겁해선 안 돼. 누군가를 턱에 한 대 갈겨야 하고, 그렇게 하고 싶은 마음이 들면, 그렇게 해야 해. 난 그냥 그런 걸 잘 못 할 뿐이지만. 난 턱에 한 대 갈기는 것보다 놈을 창밖으로 밀어버리거나 도끼로 머리를 잘라버리는 게 낫겠어. 난 주먹싸움이 싫어. 맞는 건 별로 신경 안 써. 물론 좋아하는 건 아니지만. 하지만 주먹싸움에서 가장 무서운 건 상대방의 얼굴이야. 상대방 얼굴을 쳐다볼 수가 없는 게 내 문제거든. 둘 다 눈가리개를 하거나 하면 그렇게 나쁘지 않을 텐데. 생각해보면 우스꽝스러운 종류의 비겁함이지만, 아무튼 비겁함은 맞아. 난 스스로를 속이지 않아.

내 장갑과 내 비겁함에 대해 생각할수록 더 우울해졌고, 걷는 내내 어딘가에 들러 술 한 잔 해야겠다고 결심했어. 어니네서는 겨우 석 잔 마셨고, 마지막 잔은 끝까지 마시지도 않았거든. 내가 가진 것 중 하나는 엄청난 주량이야. 내키면 밤새 마셔도 티도 안 나. 한번은 후튼 학교에서, 다른 애 레이먼드 골드파브랑 나랑 스카치 한 파인트를 사서 아무도 안 볼 토요일 밤 예배당에서 마셨어.

Style and Tone Analysis:
### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is highly informal, conversational, and deeply subjective, presented from a first-person perspective that feels like a stream of consciousness or a rambling direct address to the reader. It oscillates between cynical observation, self-deprecating humor, and moments of awkward vulnerability. The tone is distinctly adolescent, yet world-weary. It should feel like *구어체* (colloquial style) written down, heavily incorporating internal monologue.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Internal Monologue/Stream of Consciousness:** The narrator frequently interjects his thoughts, feelings, and self-corrections (e.g., "I realize that," "I really was," "You could tell"). This should be conveyed through appropriate Korean sentence endings and interjections that reflect a thinking, not just narrating, mind.
    *   **Colloquialisms & Slang:** The text is rife with informal language ("corny," "stuff," "helluva lot," "goddam," "horsing around"). Translators must find Korean equivalents that maintain the informal, slightly rough-around-the-edges quality without sounding anachronistic or overly aggressive.
    *   **Repetition:** Certain phrases or ideas are repeated for emphasis or to reflect the narrator's circular thinking (e.g., "It was a very corny book... It's corny, I realize, but it isn't too corny.").
    *   **Irony & Sarcasm:** Often used in self-description ("Suave as hell, boy") or observations of others. The Korean translation should preserve this subtle humor.
    *   **Adolescent Voice:** Despite the narrator's attempts at jadedness, his language and observations often betray his youth and inexperience. This should be a constant underlying current.

    **Recommended Narrative Speech Style:**
    For the main narration, use a highly informal and conversational tone, primarily employing the *해라체* (hae-ra-che) or *~ㄴ다/는다* declarative endings for observations and statements, mixed with *~니?* (interrogative), *~구나* (exclamatory), and *~지* (affirmative/conjectural) endings to convey the internal monologue and direct address to the reader. Emphasize colloquial expressions and interjections that simulate a natural, unpolished conversational flow (e.g., "말이야," "솔직히 말하면," "젠장," "하여간").

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Holden (Narrator)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Self/Reader (Internal Monologue), Sunny (Prostitute)
    *   **Context/Emotion (Internal Monologue/Self-address):** Reflective, self-deprecating, cynical, awkward, vulnerable, often trying to sound jaded or nonchalant but failing. His internal thoughts are often more honest than his spoken words.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style (Internal Monologue/Self-address):** As noted in the Narration Style, use the informal *해라체* or a conversational *~ㄴ다/는다* declarative style, peppered with interjections and questions directed at himself or an imagined listener.

    *   **Context/Emotion (Speaking to Sunny):** Attempts to be polite, "suave," or nonchalant, but often comes across as awkward, peculiar, and even childish. He seeks connection or conversation, which is unusual in the context, showing his underlying loneliness or naivety. He also lies about his age and name, adding to the awkwardness.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style (Speaking to Sunny):** Primarily use *해요체* (hae-yo-che) to convey his attempts at politeness and social interaction. However, the *해요체* should occasionally feel slightly forced or out of place, reflecting his underlying awkwardness and the contrast with his internal thoughts. For moments where he is particularly peculiar or naive ("Don't you feel like talking?"), the *해요체* should carry a hesitant or slightly childish tone. When asking questions like "What's your name?", *해요체* is appropriate for a relatively neutral, direct inquiry.

*   **Character: Sunny (Prostitute)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Holden (Narrator)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Blunt, direct, business-like, impatient, not particularly friendly. She is focused on the transaction. Her "Like fun you are" reveals a street-smart, disbelieving, and informal side. She is characterized as "nervous" and "young," but her dialogue is assertive and to the point.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:** Consistently use *해라체* (hae-ra-che). This speech level best conveys her bluntness, impatience, and lack of formality. Phrases like "Ya got a watch on ya?" and "Let's go, hey" should be translated with direct, unadorned *해라체* or very blunt *해체* endings. Her "Like fun you are" should be a strong, dismissive *해라체* expression (e.g., "웃기고 있네" or "말도 안 되는 소리"). Her "What the heck ya wanna talk about?" should convey annoyance and dismissiveness through *해라체*.

He got stinking, but
I hardly didn't even show it. I just got very cool and nonchalant. I puked before I went to
bed, but I didn't really have to--I forced myself. Anyway, before I got to the hotel, I started to go in this dumpy-looking bar, but
two guys came out, drunk as hell, and wanted to know where the subway was. One of
them was this very Cuban-looking guy, and he kept breathing his stinking breath in my
face while I gave him directions. I ended up not even going in the damn bar. I just went
back to the hotel. The whole lobby was empty. It smelled like fifty million dead cigars. It really did. I wasn't sleepy or anything, but I was feeling sort of lousy. Depressed and all. I almost
wished I was dead. Then, all of a sudden, I got in this big mess. The first thing when I got in the elevator, the elevator guy said to me, "Innarested
in having a good time, fella? Or is it too late for you?"
 "How do you mean?" I said. I didn't know what he was driving at or anything. "Innarested in a little tail t'night?"
 "Me?" I said. Which was a very dumb answer, but it's quite embarrassing when
somebody comes right up and asks you a question like that. "How old are you, chief?" the elevator guy said. "Why?" I said. "Twenty-two."
 "Uh huh. Well, how 'bout it? Y'innarested? Five bucks a throw. Fifteen bucks the
whole night." He looked at his wrist watch. "Till noon. Five bucks a throw, fifteen bucks
till noon."
 "Okay," I said. It was against my principles and all, but I was feeling so depressed
I didn't even think. That's the whole trouble. When you're feeling very depressed, you
can't even think. "Okay what? A throw, or till noon? I gotta know."
 "Just a throw."
 "Okay, what room ya in?"
 I looked at the red thing with my number on it, on my key. "Twelve twenty-two,"
I said. I was already sort of sorry I'd let the thing start rolling, but it was too late now. "Okay. I'll send a girl up in about fifteen minutes." He opened the doors and I got
out. "Hey, is she good-looking?" I asked him. "I don't want any old bag."
 "No old bag. Don't worry about it, chief."
 "Who do I pay?"
 "Her," he said. "Let's go, chief." He shut the doors, practically right in my face. I went to my room and put some water on my hair, but you can't really comb a
crew cut or anything. Then I tested to see if my breath stank from so many cigarettes and
the Scotch and sodas I drank at Ernie's. All you do is hold your hand under your mouth
and blow your breath up toward the old nostrils. It didn't seem to stink much, but I
brushed my teeth anyway. Then I put on another clean shirt. I knew I didn't have to get
all dolled up for a prostitute or anything, but it sort of gave me something to do. I was a
little nervous. I was starting to feel pretty sexy and all, but I was a little nervous anyway. If you want to know the truth, I'm a virgin. I really am. I've had quite a few opportunities
to lose my virginity and all, but I've never got around to it yet. Something always
happens. For instance, if you're at a girl's house, her parents always come home at the
wrong time--or you're afraid they will. Or if you're in the back seat of somebody's car,
there's always somebody's date in the front seat--some girl, I mean--that always wants to
know what's going on all over the whole goddam car. I mean some girl in front keeps
turning around to see what the hell's going on. Anyway, something always happens. I
came quite close to doing it a couple of times, though. One time in particular, I
remember. Something went wrong, though --I don't even remember what any more. The
thing is, most of the time when you're coming pretty close to doing it with a girl--a girl
that isn't a prostitute or anything, I mean--she keeps telling you to stop. The trouble with
me is, I stop. Most guys don't. I can't help it. You never know whether they really want
you to stop, or whether they're just scared as hell, or whether they're just telling you to
stop so that if you do go through with it, the blame'll be on you, not them. Anyway, I
keep stopping. The trouble is, I get to feeling sorry for them. I mean most girls are so
dumb and all. After you neck them for a while, you can really watch them losing their
brains. You take a girl when she really gets passionate, she just hasn't any brains. I don't
know. They tell me to stop, so I stop. I always wish I hadn't, after I take them home, but I
keep doing it anyway. Anyway, while I was putting on another clean shirt, I sort of figured this was my
big chance, in a way. I figured if she was a prostitute and all, I could get in some practice
on her, in case I ever get married or anything. I worry about that stuff sometimes. I read
this book once, at the Whooton School, that had this very sophisticated, suave, sexy guy
in it. Monsieur Blanchard was his name, I can still remember. It was a lousy book, but
this Blanchard guy was pretty good. He had this big château and all on the Riviera, in
Europe, and all he did in his spare time was beat women off with a club. He was a real
rake and all, but he knocked women out. He said, in this one part, that a woman's body is
like a violin and all, and that it takes a terrific musician to play it right.

솔직히 말하면, 난 동정이야. 진짜 그래. 동정을 뗄 기회가 꽤 여러 번 있었지만, 아직까지 해본 적이 없어. 항상 뭔가 일이 터지거든. 예를 들어, 여자애 집에 있으면 부모님이 하필이면 그때 집에 오거든. 아니면 그럴까 봐 두렵거나. 아니면 누구 차 뒷좌석에 있으면, 앞좌석에는 항상 누구 애인, 그러니까 어떤 여자애가 앉아 있는데, 그 빌어먹을 차 안 전체에서 대체 무슨 일이 벌어지는지 다 알고 싶어 하는 거야. 내 말은, 앞에 앉은 여자애가 계속 뒤돌아보면서 대체 무슨 일이 벌어지는지 보려고 한다는 거지. 아무튼, 항상 뭔가 일이 터져. 두어 번은 거의 할 뻔했지만 말이야. 특히 한 번은 기억나. 뭔가 잘못되긴 했는데, 이젠 뭔지도 기억 안 나. 문제는 말이야, 대부분의 경우 여자애랑 거의 하려고 할 때쯤, 매춘부나 그런 애 말고 말이야, 걔네가 계속 멈추라고 말한다는 거야. 내 문제는, 난 멈춘다는 거야. 다른 애들은 안 그러는데. 어쩔 수가 없어. 걔네가 진짜 멈추길 원하는 건지, 아니면 그냥 엄청 겁먹어서 그런 건지, 아니면 그냥 멈추라고 해서 네가 끝까지 가면 자기들 잘못이 아니라 네 잘못이 되게 하려는 건지 절대 알 수가 없어. 아무튼, 난 계속 멈춰. 문제는, 난 걔네가 불쌍하다는 생각이 든다는 거야. 내 말은, 대부분의 여자애들은 너무 멍청하거든. 좀 진하게 키스하고 나면, 걔네가 정말 이성을 잃는 걸 볼 수 있어. 여자가 정말 열정적으로 변하면, 걔네는 그냥 아무 생각도 없어. 모르겠어. 걔네가 멈추라고 하니까, 난 멈추지. 집에 데려다주고 나면 항상 그러지 말 걸 그랬다고 후회하지만, 그래도 계속 그렇게 해.

아무튼, 깨끗한 셔츠를 또 하나 입으면서, 어떤 면에서는 이게 내게 찾아온 큰 기회라고 생각했어. 매춘부라면, 나중에 결혼이라도 하게 되면 말이야, 그 여자애를 상대로 좀 연습할 수 있겠다고 생각했어. 가끔 그런 것 때문에 걱정돼. 한 번은 후튼 학교에서 어떤 책을 읽었는데, 거기 아주 세련되고 능글맞고 섹시한 남자가 나왔어. 블랑샤르 씨가 그 이름이었는데, 아직도 기억나. 형편없는 책이었지만, 이 블랑샤르라는 남자는 꽤 괜찮았어. 그는 유럽 리비에라에 아주 큰 성 같은 걸 가지고 있었고, 여가 시간에는 여자들이 들끓어 몽둥이로 쫓아내야 할 정도였지. 진정한 난봉꾼이었는데, 여자들을 홀딱 반하게 만들었어. 그 책의 한 부분에서 그는 여자의 몸은 바이올린 같다고 했어. 그걸 제대로 연주하려면 엄청난 연주자가 필요하다고 말이야.

Style and Tone Analysis:
Here are the practical, actionable guidelines for the translator, focusing on maintaining the consistent and context-aware tone and speaking style of the original English text.

---

### 1. Narration Style
*   **Overall Tone:** The narration is a first-person, stream-of-consciousness, highly colloquial, and informal style. It should convey a cynical, observational, and slightly jaded tone, characteristic of a young, disillusioned protagonist. The Korean translation should aim for a casual, almost conversational feel, as if the narrator is speaking directly to the reader in an unvarnished manner. This often translates to a **반말체 (non-honorific style)** or a very informal **해요체** that leans towards **해라체** in its directness and lack of formality.
*   **Key Literary Devices:**
    *   **Internal Monologue:** Crucial for understanding the narrator's thoughts, feelings, and judgments. These parts should be rendered in a very intimate and unfiltered **해라체** (non-honorific declarative style), reflecting the inner workings of his mind.
    *   **Colloquialism/Slang:** Words like "wuddayacallit," "goddam," "what the heck," "crumb-bum" should be translated with equivalent Korean informalities, expletives, or slang that match the level of casualness and mild vulgarity. Avoid overly polite or formal expressions.
    *   **Repetition:** Preserve instances of repetition (e.g., "Do you mind very much?") to convey the narrator's nervousness or emphasis.
    *   **Digressions:** The narrator's frequent shifts to tangential thoughts (e.g., about the girl's dress, movie actors) are integral to his character. Ensure these transitions feel natural within the informal narrative flow.
    *   **Direct Address to Reader:** Phrases like "if you want to know the truth" should maintain the sense of the narrator confiding directly in the reader, using an informal tone.

### 2. Dialogue Guidelines

*   **Character: Narrator (Holden Caulfield)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Sunny (the prostitute)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Holden is primarily anxious, uncomfortable, and desperate to end the encounter without offending her too much, but also increasingly frustrated, annoyed, and dishonest. He initiates with a veneer of politeness, which quickly devolves into exasperation and directness as his lies pile up and his patience wears thin.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   **Initial Polite Rejection/Pleading:** Start with **해요체** (polite informal) to convey a semblance of politeness while making his request (e.g., "Do you mind very much if we don't do it?"). However, ensure it's a nervous, slightly pleading **해요체**, not a genuinely respectful one.
        *   **Lying/Evasion:** As he fabricates stories ("I had an operation," "my clavichord"), maintain **해요체** but with an increasingly fumbling, uncertain, or desperate tone. He's trying to sound convincing but isn't entirely successful.
        *   **Exasperation/Frustration:** When he becomes annoyed or more direct ("Do you mind cutting it out?", "I'm not in the mood"), transition to a more forceful **해요체** or even **해체** (plain informal) to convey his impatience and demand.
        *   **Negotiation/Firmness:** When discussing money, use a firm **해요체** that conveys resolution ("that's all I'm gonna shell out").
        *   **Final Dismissal:** His "So long" should be a blunt **해체**, reflecting his desire to be rid of her without any lingering politeness.

*   **Character: Sunny (the prostitute)**
    *   **Speaking to:** Narrator (Holden Caulfield)
    *   **Context/Emotion:** Initially she is direct, somewhat blank, and unengaged. As Holden's attempts to dismiss her become clear, she progresses through confusion, disbelief, skepticism, and then escalating anger, crudeness, and sarcasm. She is a young, easily provoked professional.
    *   **Recommended Speech Style:**
        *   **Initial Unengaged/Blunt Statements:** Use **해체** (plain informal) for her very brief, direct answers ("Sleep. Go to the show."). This reflects her uninvested demeanor and directness.
        *   **Skepticism/Direct Questioning:** For questions like "What'sa matter?", "Yeah? Where?", and "Where the hell's that?", use a direct and slightly confrontational **해체**. The vulgarity of "Where the hell's that?" should be mirrored with an equivalent blunt, possibly slightly rude, Korean expression.
        *   **Provocation/Familiarity:** Her "You're cute" should also be **해체**, signaling a casual, almost proprietorial familiarity despite the short acquaintance.
        *   **Crude Conversation/Persistence:** When discussing the movie actor, maintain **해체**. Her speech is unrefined, persistent, and lacks formal education, conveying a certain low-brow familiarity.
        *   **Anger/Accusation/Hostility:** This is a crucial shift. Her "Listen," "What the heck did you tell that crazy Maurice you wanted a girl for, then?" and her subsequent demands should be rendered in a highly confrontational, accusatory, and potentially vulgar **해체**. The "goddam" repetitions should be translated with appropriate Korean expletives or intensifiers to convey her rage and crudeness.
        *   **Sarcastic/Cold Demand:** Her final request, "Do you mind getting me my frock? Or would it be too much trouble?", even with the somewhat formal word "frock," is delivered "very cold." This should be translated with a **해체** that carries a heavy weight of sarcasm and thinly veiled contempt, perhaps through specific Korean particles or intonation markers that convey disdain despite the grammatical plainness. The "little bitty voice" is a physical attribute, not a reflection of her speech level; her words are sharp and cutting.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
It was a very
corny book--I realize that--but I couldn't get that violin stuff out of my mind anyway. In a
way, that's why I sort of wanted to get some practice in, in case I ever get married. Caulfield and his Magic Violin, boy. It's corny, I realize, but it isn't too corny. I wouldn't
mind being pretty good at that stuff. Half the time, if you really want to know the truth,
when I'm horsing around with a girl, I have a helluva lot of trouble just finding what I'm
looking for, for God's sake, if you know what I mean. Take this girl that I just missed
having sexual intercourse with, that I told you about. It took me about an hour to just get
her goddam brassiere off. By the time I did get it off, she was about ready to spit in my
eye. Anyway, I kept walking around the room, waiting for this prostitute to show up. I
kept hoping she'd be good-looking. I didn't care too much, though. I sort of just wanted to
get it over with. Finally, somebody knocked on the door, and when I went to open it, I
had my suitcase right in the way and I fell over it and damn near broke my knee. I always
pick a gorgeous time to fall over a suitcase or something. When I opened the door, this prostitute was standing there. She had a polo coat
on, and no hat. She was sort of a blonde, but you could tell she dyed her hair. She wasn't
any old bag, though. "How do you do," I said. Suave as hell, boy. "You the guy Maurice said?" she asked me. She didn't seem too goddam friendly. "Is he the elevator boy?"
 "Yeah," she said. "Yes, I am. Come in, won't you?" I said. I was getting more and more nonchalant
as it went along. I really was. She came in and took her coat off right away and sort of chucked it on the bed. She had on a green dress underneath. Then she sort of sat down sideways on the chair
that went with the desk in the room and started jiggling her foot up and down. She
crossed her legs and started jiggling this one foot up and down. She was very nervous, for
a prostitute. She really was. I think it was because she was young as hell. She was around
my age. I sat down in the big chair, next to her, and offered her a cigarette. "I don't
smoke," she said. She had a tiny little wheeny-whiny voice. You could hardly hear her. She never said thank you, either, when you offered her something. She just didn't know
any better. "Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Jim Steele," I said. "Ya got a watch on ya?" she said. She didn't care what the hell my name was,
naturally. "Hey, how old are you, anyways?"
 "Me? Twenty-two."
 "Like fun you are."
 It was a funny thing to say. It sounded like a real kid. You'd think a prostitute and
all would say "Like hell you are" or "Cut the crap" instead of "Like fun you are."
 "How old are you?" I asked her. "Old enough to know better," she said. She was really witty. "Ya got a watch on
ya?" she asked me again, and then she stood up and pulled her dress over her head. I certainly felt peculiar when she did that. I mean she did it so sudden and all. I
know you're supposed to feel pretty sexy when somebody gets up and pulls their dress
over their head, but I didn't. Sexy was about the last thing I was feeling. I felt much more
depressed than sexy. "Ya got a watch on ya, hey?"
 "No. No, I don't," I said. Boy, was I feeling peculiar. "What's your name?" I asked
her. All she had on was this pink slip. It was really quite embarrassing. It really was. "Sunny," she said. "Let's go, hey."
 "Don't you feel like talking for a while?" I asked her. It was a childish thing to
say, but I was feeling so damn peculiar. "Are you in a very big hurry?"
 She looked at me like I was a madman. "What the heck ya wanna talk about?" she
said. "I don't know. Nothing special. I just thought perhaps you might care to chat for a
while."
 She sat down in the chair next to the desk again. She didn't like it, though, you
could tell. She started jiggling her foot again--boy, she was a nervous girl. "Would you care for a cigarette now?" I said. I forgot she didn't smoke. "I don't smoke. Listen, if you're gonna talk, do it. I got things to do."
 I couldn't think of anything to talk about, though. I thought of asking her how she
got to be a prostitute and all, but I was scared to ask her. She probably wouldn't've told
me anyway. "You don't come from New York, do you?" I said finally. That's all I could think
of. "Hollywood," she said. Then she got up and went over to where she'd put her
dress down, on the bed. "Ya got a hanger? I don't want to get my dress all wrinkly. It's
brand-clean."
 "Sure," I said right away. I was only too glad to get up and do something. I took
her dress over to the closet and hung it up for her. It was funny. It made me feel sort of
sad when I hung it up. I thought of her going in a store and buying it, and nobody in the
store knowing she was a prostitute and all. The salesman probably just thought she was a
regular girl when she bought it. It made me feel sad as hell--I don't know why exactly. I sat down again and tried to keep the old conversation going. She was a lousy
conversationalist. "Do you work every night?" I asked her--it sounded sort of awful, after
I'd said it.

"그럼요." 내가 바로 말했어. 뭔가 일어나서 할 수 있어서 너무 좋았거든. 걔 드레스를 옷장으로 가져가서 걸어줬어. 웃겼지. 그거 걸면서 왠지 슬퍼지는 거야. 걔가 가게에 가서 그걸 사고, 가게 사람 아무도 걔가 매춘부라는 걸 모르는 모습을 떠올렸어. 점원은 그냥 평범한 여자애라고 생각했겠지, 걔가 살 때 말이야. 빌어먹을 만큼 슬퍼졌어—왜 그랬는지는 나도 잘 모르겠어.

다시 앉아서 예전처럼 대화를 이어가려고 했어. 걔는 최악의 대화 상대였거든. "매일 밤 일하세요?" 내가 걔한테 물었어—말하고 나니 좀 끔찍하게 들리긴 했지만.
