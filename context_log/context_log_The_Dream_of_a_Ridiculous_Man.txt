Style and Tone Analysis:
- **Specific Character Dialogue:**
  - **Narrator:** (Speaks with a detached, almost clinical tone regarding his own death and burial. Maintains a reflective, philosophical stance even in the face of extreme circumstances. The direct address to a higher power is a notable deviation in this otherwise internal reflection, characterized by its intensity and the use of strong, declarative statements of defiance and contempt.)

### Immediate Context Used (English):
quite unawares.

Dreams, as we all know, are very queer things: some parts are presented with appalling vividness, with details worked up with the elaborate finish of jewellery, while others one gallops through, as it were, without noticing them at all, as, for instance, through space and time. Dreams seem to be spurred on not by reason but by desire, not by the head but by the heart, and yet what complicated tricks my reason has played sometimes in dreams, what utterly incomprehensible things happen to it! My brother died five years ago, for instance. I sometimes dream of him; he takes part in my affairs, we are very much interested, and yet all through my dream I quite know and remember that my brother is dead and buried. How is it that I am not surprised that, though he is dead, he is here beside me and working with me? Why is it that my reason fully accepts it? But enough. I will begin about my dream. Yes, I dreamed a dream, my dream of the third of November. They tease me now, telling me it was only a dream. But does it matter whether it was a dream or reality, if the dream made known to me the truth? If once one has recognized the truth and seen it, you know that it is the truth and that there is no other and there cannot be, whether you are asleep or awake. Let it be a dream, so be it, but that real life of which you make so much I had meant to extinguish by suicide, and my dream, my dream—oh, it revealed to me a different life, renewed, grand and full of power!

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
꿈 전체를 통틀어 나는 내 형이 죽어서 묻혔다는 것을 완전히 알고 기억한다. 죽었음에도 불구하고 그가 내 곁에 와서 나와 함께 일하고 있다는 사실에 내가 왜 놀라지 않는가? 내 이성이 그것을 완전히 받아들이는 이유는 무엇인가? 하지만 충분하다. 나는 내 꿈에 대해 이야기하기 시작할 것이다. 그렇다, 나는 꿈을 꾸었다. 내가 꿈꾼 것은 11월 3일의 꿈이었다. 그들은 이제 나를 놀린다. 그것은 단지 꿈일 뿐이었다고. 그러나 그것이 꿈이었는지 현실이었는지는 무슨 상관이 있는가, 만약 그 꿈이 나에게 진리를 알게 해주었다면? 만약 누군가 진리를 인식하고 그것을 본다면, 당신은 그것이 진리이고 다른 진리는 없으며 있을 수 없다는 것을 알지 않는가? 당신이 자고 있든 깨어 있든 말이다. 꿈이라고 하자. 그렇다면 좋지만, 당신이 그렇게 중요하게 생각하는 실제 삶은 내가 자살로 끝내려고 했던 것이고, 나의 꿈, 나의 꿈은… 오, 그것은 나에게 새롭고 위대하며 힘이 넘치는 다른 삶을 보여주었다!

Style and Tone Analysis:
- **Tone/Mood Shift:** The tone shifts dramatically from contemplative and melancholic to defensive and accusatory, particularly in the third paragraph, as the narrator anticipates disbelief and outright rejection of their account.
- **Specific Character Dialogue:**
    - **Narrator:** The narrator's speech becomes increasingly agitated and self-justifying, laced with rhetorical questions and appeals to the listener's judgment ("Oh, judge for yourselves"). They express a desperate need for validation while simultaneously acknowledging the potential for their account to be dismissed as delusion.
- **Literary Devices:**
    - **Extended Metaphor/Analogy:** The narrator uses the concept of dreams and their own inner turmoil (yearning melancholy, hatred/love for humanity) to frame their experiences.
    - **Direct Address to Reader/Listener:** The narrator frequently breaks the fourth wall, directly engaging the reader/listener ("everyone laughs in my face now," "You know, I will tell you a secret"). This creates a sense of confession and urgency.
    - **Juxtaposition:** The narrator contrasts the perceived innocence and harmony of the "them" with their own internal conflict and the "awful" event that transpired, highlighting a stark divergence.

### Immediate Context Used (English):
at the arrival of children as new beings to share their happiness. There was no quarrelling, no jealousy among them, and they did not even know what the words meant. Their children were the children of all, for they all made up one family. There was scarcely any illness among them, though there was death; but their old people died peacefully, as though falling asleep, giving blessings and smiles to those who surrounded them to take their last farewell with bright and lovely smiles. I never saw grief or tears on those occasions, but only love, which reached the point of ecstasy, but a calm ecstasy, made perfect and contemplative. One might think that they were still in contact with the departed after death, and that their earthly union was not cut short by death. They scarcely understood me when I questioned them about immortality, but evidently they were so convinced of it without reasoning that it was not for them a question at all. They had no temples, but they had a real living and uninterrupted sense of oneness with the whole of the universe; they had no creed, but they had a certain knowledge that when their earthly joy had reached the limits of earthly nature, then there would come for them, for the living and for the dead, a still greater fullness of contact with the whole of the universe. They looked forward to that moment with joy, but without haste, not pining for it, but seeming to have a foretaste of it in their hearts, of which they talked to one another.

### Immediate Context Used (Korean):
나는 그런 경우에 슬픔이나 눈물을 결코 보지 못했지만, 오직 황홀경에 달할 정도의 사랑만 보았을 뿐이다. 그러나 그것은 완전하고 사색적인 고요한 황홀경이었다. 그들은 죽음 후에도 죽은 자들과 계속 접촉하고 있었고, 그들의 지상적 결합이 죽음으로 단절되지 않았다고 생각할 수도 있을 것이다. 그들은 내가 불멸에 대해 물었을 때 나를 거의 이해하지 못했지만, 그들은 추론 없이 그것을 너무나 확신했기 때문에 그것은 그들에게 전혀 문제가 되지 않았다. 그들에게는 신전이 없었지만, 우주 전체와의 진정한 살아있는, 끊김 없는 일체감을 가지고 있었다. 그들에게는 신조가 없었지만, 그들의 지상적인 기쁨이 지상적인 자연의 한계에 도달했을 때, 죽은 자와 산 자 모두에게 우주 전체와의 더욱 큰 충만함이 올 것이라는 어떤 지식이 있었다. 그들은 그 순간을 기쁨으로 기다렸지만 서두르지 않고, 그것을 갈망하지 않고, 오히려 마음속에서 그것을 미리 맛보는 듯했고, 그들은 서로에게 그것에 대해 이야기했다.
