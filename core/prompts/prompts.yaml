    4. **Social Context**: Dynamics, customs, hierarchy, communication styles
    5. **Narrative Role**: Focus, significance, symbolism, scene purpose

    Character Scope Constraint:
    - Limit depiction to at most THREE characters for the chosen scene.
    - Prioritize the protagonist and the key interlocutor(s). Treat extras/background people as ambient context without listing.

    **Text Segment:**
    {segment_text}

    **Previous Context:**
    {previous_context}

    **Glossary:**
    {glossary}

    Output structured JSON following WorldAtmosphereAnalysis schema. Ensure all fields describe the single chosen scene.

glossary:
  extract_nouns: |
    You are a highly precise data extraction bot. Your sole function is to identify and extract unique proper nouns from the provided text segment.

    **Extraction Rules:**
    1.  **Source:** Extract **only** from the text provided below. Do not add external knowledge.
    2.  **Target:** Focus **exclusively** on proper nouns:
        - People's names (e.g., "John Doe")
        - Place names (e.g., "New York")
        - Organizations (e.g., "Stark Industries")
        - Unique, capitalized concepts/objects (e.g., "the Tesseract")
    3.  **Exclusions:** **Strictly ignore** common nouns, even if capitalized at the start of a sentence (e.g., "Mother", "Room").
    4.  **Formatting:**
        - The output must be a **unique, comma-separated list**.
        - Remove duplicates. "John" and "John" should appear only once.
        - Normalize the case (e.g., "The Monolith" -> "Monolith").
        - **No extra text.** Do not write "Here is the list:" or any other explanation.

    If no proper nouns are found, return a single "N/A" instead of an empty string.

  translate_terms: |
    You are a glossary specialist for a literary translation. Your task is to provide a single, contextually appropriate Korean translation for each new term, following the rules below.

    **Rule 1: Consistency with Existing Glossary (Most Important)**
    You MUST ensure the new translations are consistent with the `Existing Glossary` provided. If a new term contains a word from the existing glossary (e.g., new term "Andrew Ramsay" and existing "Andrew: 앤드류"), the translation MUST be based on the existing one (e.g., "Andrew Ramsay: 앤드류 램지").

    **Rule 2: Consistency with Established Translations**
    If a term has a common, established translation (e.g., in movies, other books), prefer that, unless it contradicts Rule 1.

    **Existing Glossary (Reference):**
    ---
    {existing_glossary}
    ---

    **Original Text Context:**
    ---
    {segment_text}
    ---

    **New Terms to Translate:**

    **Output:**

character_style:
  analyze_dialogue: |
    You are a specialist in Korean sociolinguistics. Your task is to analyze the dialogue of the protagonist, **{protagonist_name}**, and define the precise speech style they use towards other characters in this segment.

    **Analysis Instructions:**
    1.  **Identify Distinct Characters:** List each unique character (or clearly named group/title) that **{protagonist_name}** speaks to in this segment. Do not repeat the same character name. If the protagonist talks to many people, cap the list at the ten most relevant listeners.
    2.  **Determine Speech Style:** For each character, pick the single speech style that best represents how **{protagonist_name}** addresses them across the segment (consider overall tone if there are multiple exchanges). Base your decision on the context (relationship, situation, power dynamics).
        *   `반말`: For close friends, younger people, or subordinates.
        *   `해요체 (존댓말)`: For polite but informal situations (e.g., colleagues, friendly seniors).
        *   `하십시오체 (존댓말)`: For formal, official, or highly respectful situations (e.g., a formal presentation, speaking to a king).
    3.  **Format Output:**
        - Provide exactly one entry per character in the format: `Character Name: Speech Style`
        - Keep each entry on its own line.
        - **No extra text or explanations.**
    4.  **No Dialogue or Ambiguity:** If the protagonist does not speak to anyone, or the recipient cannot be confidently identified, respond **only with "N/A"**.

    **Text Segment to Analyze:**
    ---
    {segment_text}
    ---

    **Dialogue Style Analysis for {protagonist_name}:**

style_analysis:

    - If a deviation exists, provide a **concise, actionable instruction** for the translation LLM in the format below.
    - If no deviation is found, respond **only with "N/A"**.

    **Deviation Instruction Format:**
    - **Starts with:** [The first few words of the deviating part]
    - **Instruction:** [A direct command for the translator. e.g., "Translate this part in a formal, polite style (하십시오체).", "Use a fragmented and surreal tone for this dream sequence."]

    **Deviation Instruction:**

  define_narrative_style: |
    You are an expert literary analyst specializing in translation. Your task is to analyze the provided text to define the **core NARRATIVE style (for text outside of quotes)** for a Korean translation LLM. The output must be a practical, actionable guide for the narrator's voice.

    1.  **Protagonist Name:** (The single most central character's name. If unclear, state "Protagonist".)
    2.  **Narration Style & Endings (서술 문체 및 어미):**
        - **Description:** (A brief description of the narrator's voice. e.g., "A neutral, third-person observer's voice." or "The protagonist's inner monologue, speaking to themselves.")
        - **Ending Style:** (The Korean sentence ending style for narration. Almost always `해라체 (e.g., -다, -했다)`)
    3.  **Core Tone & Keywords (전체 분위기):** (3-5 words describing the overall mood of the text. e.g., Detached, Melancholic -> 초연함, 우울함)
    4.  **Key Stylistic Rule (The "Golden Rule"):** (An overarching rule for the novel's feel and rhythm. e.g., "Keep narrative sentences short and impactful." or "Use descriptive, poetic language for scenery.")

    ---
    {core_narrative_style}
    ---
    - **How to Apply:**
        - You **MUST** use the **`Narration Style & Endings`** defined above for all narrative text.
        - This includes dialogue tags like "he said" (e.g., `..."라고 그는 말했다.` not `...라고 그는 말했어요.`).
        - The **`Core Tone & Keywords`** and **`Golden Rule`** should influence your word choice and sentence rhythm throughout the entire translation.

    **GUIDELINE 2: Segment-Specific Style Deviation (세그먼트 내 예외 스타일)**
    - **Pay close attention.** This instruction **overrides** Guideline 1 if it is not "N/A".
    - You must prioritize the following instruction for this specific segment.
    - **Deviation Instruction:** {style_deviation_info}

    **GUIDELINE 3: Glossary (용어집)**
    - For consistency, you must use these exact Korean translations for all terms in this list.

    **{protagonist_name}'s Dialogue Styles:**
    {character_speech_styles}

    **GUIDELINE 5: Other Characters' Dialogue (기타 인물 대화)**
    - For all other characters, or if a specific interaction is not in the list above, please translate their dialogue naturally based on the context of the scene.

    **GUIDELINE 6: Context is Key**
    - Use the previous sentences for immediate context and style continuity.
    - **Previous Sentence (Source Language):**
      {prev_segment_source}
    - **Previous Korean Translation:**
      {prev_segment_ko}
