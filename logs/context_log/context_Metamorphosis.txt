### Immediate language Context (Previous Segment Ending):
not opening the door”, Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of course, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.
Gregor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he knew who it was—the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even necessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.
There was a loud thump, but it wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was softened a little by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was also more elastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.

최소 두 시간은 회사 업무에 시간을 쏟지 않으면 양심의 가책에 미쳐 침대에서 나올 수 없을 정도로 충실하고 헌신적인 사람은 단 한 명도 없단 말인가? 수습 직원 중 한 명에게 문의하게 하는 것으로는 정말 부족했단 말인가—문의가 필요하다는 가정하에라도—지배인이 직접 와야만 했는가? 그리고 이 일이 너무나 의심스러워 오직 지배인만이 현명하게 조사할 수 있다고 온 가족에게 보여줘야만 했는가? 그리고 어떤 합리적인 결정에 의해서라기보다는 이 생각들이 그를 화나게 만들었기 때문에, 그는 온 힘을 다해 침대 밖으로 몸을 흔들어 떨어뜨렸다. 쿵 하는 큰 소리가 났지만, 실제로는 큰 소리가 아니었다. 그의 낙하는 카펫에 의해 약간 완화되었고, 그레고르의 등은 그가 생각했던 것보다 더 탄력적이었다. 그로 인해 소리는 둔탁하고 그다지 눈에 띄지 않았다. 하지만 그는 머리를 충분히 조심스럽게 들고 있지 않았고, 떨어지면서 머리를 부딪혔다. 짜증이 나고 고통스러웠던 그는 머리를 돌려 카펫에 비볐다.

head disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.
Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.

So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its façade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below.

### Immediate Korean Context (Previous Segment Ending):
이런 식으로 그의 몸 절반만 보였고, 그 위로 다른 사람들을 엿보기 위해 한쪽으로 기울인 그의 머리가 함께 보였다. 그 사이 날은 훨씬 더 밝아졌다. 길 건너편에 있는—병원인—끝없이 이어진, 회색빛 검은 건물의 일부가 외벽을 뚫고 있는 엄격하고 규칙적인 창문들과 함께 아주 선명하게 보였다. 비는 여전히 내리고 있었고, 이제는 커다란 빗방울들이 하나씩 떨어져 땅에 부딪혔다. 아침 식사 설거지가 식탁 위에 놓여 있었다. 그레고르의 아버지에게는 아침 식사가 하루 중 가장 중요한 식사였고, 여러 종류의 신문을 읽으며 몇 시간 동안이나 식사를 늘어뜨리곤 했기 때문에 설거지 양이 아주 많았다. 정면 벽에는 그레고르가 육군 소위였을 때의 사진이 걸려 있었는데, 그는 칼을 손에 들고 근심 없는 미소를 지으며 자신의 제복과 자세에 대한 존경심을 불러일으키는 듯했다. 현관으로 통하는 문이 열려 있었고 아파트 현관문 또한 열려 있었으므로, 그는 아래로 이어지는 착륙장과 계단을 볼 수 있었다.

### Immediate language Context (Previous Segment Ending):
one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides.

It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor’s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.
For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he had been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It pressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift his head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.

He spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being he must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.

### Immediate Korean Context (Previous Segment Ending):
자신의 삶을 어떻게 재정비해야 할지 방해받지 않고 생각할 충분한 시간을 주었다.

왠지 모르게, 그가 바닥에 납작하게 누워 머물러야 했던 높고 텅 빈 방은 그곳에서 5년 동안 살았음에도 불구하고 그를 불안하게 만들었다. 약간의 수치심 외에는 자신이 무엇을 하는지 거의 의식하지 못한 채, 그는 소파 밑으로 서둘러 들어갔다. 그것은 그의 등을 약간 눌렀고, 그는 더 이상 머리를 들 수 없었다. 그러나 그는 즉시 편안함을 느꼈고, 유일한 후회는 자신의 몸이 너무 넓어 전부 밑으로 들어갈 수 없다는 것이었다.

그는 그곳에서 밤을 새웠다. 그는 일부 시간을 얕은 잠으로 보냈지만, 배고픔 때문에 자주 놀라 깨어났다. 그리고 일부 시간은 걱정과 막연한 희망 속에서 보냈는데, 그러나 그것들은 항상 같은 결론에 도달했다. 당분간 그는 침착함을 유지해야 하고, 인내심과 최대한의 배려를 보여 가족들이 현재 상태의 자신이 그들에게 강요할 수밖에 없는 불쾌함을 견딜 수 있도록 해야 한다는 것이었다.

have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on.

If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into Gregor’s room, then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him with the windows closed.

### Immediate Korean Context (Previous Segment Ending):
여동생은 당연히 가능한 한 그것이 전혀 부담스럽지 않은 척하려 노력했고, 시간이 지날수록 물론 더 잘 그렇게 할 수 있었다. 그러나 시간이 흐르면서 그레고르 역시 그 모든 것을 훨씬 더 잘 꿰뚫어 볼 수 있었다. 이제 그녀가 방에 들어올 때마다 그에게는 심지어 매우 불쾌해졌다. 그녀는 들어오자마자 아무도 그레고르의 방 안을 들여다보는 고통을 겪지 않도록 예방 차원에서 재빨리 문을 닫았다. 그리고는 곧장 창문으로 가서 거의 질식할 것 같은 듯이 서둘러 창문을 활짝 열었다. 심지어 추운 날씨에도 그녀는 잠시 동안 창가에 서서 깊이 숨을 쉬었다. 그녀는 하루에 두 번씩 이렇게 부산하게 움직이고 소리를 내며 그레고르를 놀라게 했다. 그는 내내 소파 밑에서 몸을 떨었다. 그녀가 분명히 자신에게 이런 시련을 면하게 해주고 싶었을 테지만, 창문을 닫은 채 그와 같은 방에 있는 것은 불가능하다는 것을 잘 알고 있었다. 그녀가 등을 돌리자마자 그레고르는 다시 소파 밑에서 나와 몸을 쭉 폈다.

### Immediate language Context (Previous Segment Ending):
“Oh God, oh God!” Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. “Gregor!” shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too—he could save his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut Gregor’s face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door shut with her foot. So now Gregor was shut out from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table.

### Immediate Korean Context (Previous Segment Ending):
조언이라도 할 수 있는 것처럼 다음 방으로 달려갔다. 그러나 그는 그녀 뒤에 서서 아무것도 하지 못하고 있어야 했다. 그녀는 여러 병들을 들여다보고 있었는데, 그녀가 돌아서자 그가 그녀를 놀라게 했다. 병 하나가 바닥에 떨어져 깨졌다. 파편이 그레고르의 얼굴을 베었고, 어떤 종류의 부식성 약물이 온몸에 튀었다. 이제 더 이상 지체하지 않고 그레테는 잡을 수 있는 모든 병들을 움켜쥐고 그것들을 가지고 어머니에게로 달려갔다. 그녀는 발로 문을 쾅 닫았다. 그래서 이제 그레고르는 어머니에게서 차단되었다. 어머니는 그 때문에 죽음에 가까울 수도 있었다. 그는 여동생을 쫓아내고 싶지 않다면 문을 열 수 없었고, 여동생은 어머니와 함께 있어야 했다. 그가 할 일은 기다리는 것뿐이었다. 그리고 불안과 자책감에 짓눌려 그는 기어 다니기 시작했다. 그는 모든 것 위로 기어 다녔다. 벽, 가구, 천장. 그리고 마침내 온 방이 그를 중심으로 돌기 시작하는 혼란 속에서 그는 식탁 한가운데로 떨어졌다.

### Immediate language Context (Previous Segment Ending):
But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people, Gregor’s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in Gregor’s back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had come back from taking his father to bed Gregor’s mother and sister would now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother would point to Gregor’s room and say “Close that door, Grete”, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.

### Immediate Korean Context (Previous Segment Ending):
이사를 결정하지 못하게 막는 주된 이유는 그들의 완전한 절망과, 자신들이 아는 또는 친척 관계에 있는 누구도 겪어보지 못한 불행에 휩싸였다는 생각과 훨씬 더 관련이 있었다. 그들은 세상이 가난한 사람들에게 기대하는 모든 것을 절대적으로 수행했다. 그레고르의 아버지는 은행 직원들에게 아침 식사를 가져다주었고, 그의 어머니는 낯선 사람들의 옷을 빨아주며 자신을 희생했으며, 그의 여동생은 고객의 요청에 따라 책상 뒤에서 이리저리 뛰어다녔다. 그러나 그들은 더 이상 할 힘이 없었다. 그리고 그레고르의 등에 박힌 상처는 처음처럼 다시 아프기 시작했다. 아버지를 침대에 모셔다드리고 돌아온 후 그레고르의 어머니와 여동생은 이제 하던 일을 그대로 두고 뺨을 맞대고 나란히 앉곤 했다. 어머니는 그레고르의 방을 가리키며 “저 문 닫아라, 그레테.”라고 말했다. 그리고 그가 다시 어둠 속에 있게 되면, 그들은 옆방에 앉아 눈물을 섞거나, 아니면 그저 마른 눈으로 식탁을 응시하며 앉아 있곤 했다.

### Immediate language Context (Previous Segment Ending):
Yet Gregor’s sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.
Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come and gone already?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.

### Immediate Korean Context (Previous Segment Ending):
결심했다. 이곳에서는 아무도 자신만큼 그녀의 연주를 감상하지 못했기 때문이다. 그는 그가 살아있는 한, 절대로 그녀를 방 밖으로 내보내고 싶지 않았다. 그의 충격적인 외모가 한 번쯤은 그에게 유용하게 쓰여야 했다. 그는 방의 모든 문에 동시에 서서 공격자들에게 쉭쉭거리고 침을 뱉고 싶었다. 하지만 여동생은 그와 함께 있도록 강요받아서는 안 되었고, 자신의 자유 의지로 머물러야 했다. 그는 그녀에게 자신이 늘 그녀를 음악원에 보내려 했음을, 이 불행이 방해하지 않았다면 지난 크리스마스에—크리스마스가 정말로 벌써 지나간 것인가?—모든 사람에게 그 사실을 말했을 것임을, 그리고 누구도 자신을 단념시키지 못하게 할 것임을 말하는 동안, 그녀는 소파에 그의 옆에 앉아 그에게 귀를 기울였을 것이다. 이 모든 것을 들으면 여동생은 감격의 눈물을 터뜨릴 것이고, 그레고르는 그녀의 어깨로 기어 올라가 목에 입을 맞출 것이었다. 그녀는 직장 생활을 한 이후 목걸이나 칼라 없이 목을 드러내고 있었다.

himself, and the three women followed his example. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just look how thin he was. He didn’t eat anything for so long. The food came out again just the same as when it went in”. Gregor’s body was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make them look away.

“Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs. Samsa with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of March, after all.

The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. “Where is our breakfast?”, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.
She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor’s room. They did so, and stood around Gregor’s corpse with their hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.

Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face against her father’s arm.

않았다.

“그레테, 이리로 잠깐 같이 가자,” 잠자 부인은 고통스러운 미소를 지으며 말했다. 그레테는 시신을 다시 보며 부모님을 따라 침실로 들어갔다. 청소부는 문을 닫고 창문을 활짝 열었다. 아직 이른 아침이었지만 신선한 공기에는 따뜻함이 섞여 있었다. 어쨌든 이미 3월 말이었다.

세 신사는 자신들의 방에서 나와 아침 식사를 찾으며 놀라움 속에서 주위를 둘러보았다. 그들은 잊혀져 있었다. “우리 아침 식사는 어디 있습니까?” 가운데 신사가 청소부에게 짜증스럽게 물었다. 그녀는 그저 입술에 손가락을 대고 남자들에게 그레고르의 방으로 들어오고 싶을지도 모른다는 빠르고 조용한 신호를 보냈다. 그들은 그렇게 했고, 낡은 코트 주머니에 손을 넣은 채 그레고르의 시신 주위에 서 있었다. 이제 방은 꽤 밝았다.

그때 침실 문이 열리고 잠자 씨가 제복 차림으로 한 팔에는 아내를, 다른 팔에는 딸을 데리고 나타났다. 그들 모두는 조금 울었었다. 그레테는 이따금 아버지의 팔에 얼굴을 기댔다.
